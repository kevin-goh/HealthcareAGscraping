       "['[\\'While the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have signed off on updated COVID vaccines for this season, Moderna is already reportedly preparing for lower demand for its shot.\\', \\'Moderna is speaking with its manufacturing partners to scale back production of its mRNA COVID vaccine Spikevax to cope with the endemic phase of the disease, Moderna’s president and R&D head, Stephen Hoge, said, Reuters reports.\\', \\'“Over the past couple of years, we’ve been in pandemic mode producing a billion doses a year,” Hoge said, as quoted by Reuters. “We’ve been waiting for the moment when the pandemic was officially behind us that we would need to restructure that manufacturing footprint.”\\', \\'The discussions are with vial fillers, according to Reuters. Moderna’s manufacturing partners include Thermo Fisher, which offers its fill-finish services through a 15-year strategic collaboration signed last year. Catalent also provides Moderna vial filling and packaging capacity under a 2020 deal. Sanofi agreed in 2021 to perform fill and finish of up to 200 million doses of Moderna’s COVID vaccine.\\', \\'Separately, Lonza helps manufacture the drug substance for Moderna’s COVID vaccine under a 10-year agreement penned in 2020.\\', \\'Moderna has been feeling the burn from declining demand for many months. In the second quarter, the Massachusetts company took $674 million in impairment charges over inventory write-downs, idle manufacturing capacity and the cancellation of purchase agreements. The number was $378 million in the first quarter.\\', \"Now, because of new interest in the updated monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID shot, the company’s inventory of last year\\'s bivalent version has become obsolete. Customer demand has dropped, too, Moderna said last month.\", \\'But cutting back manufacturing scale won’t happen overnight or even in time for this season. Talks with contract manufacturers could extend into 2024, Hoge said.\\', \\'“These are relationships that we will need for decades to come,” he said, as quoted by Reuters.\\', \\'FEATURED EVENT\\', \\'14-16 November 2023\\', \\'London, UK\\', \\'For 2023, Moderna expects sales to come within a range of $6 billion to $8 billion, which will rely heavily on the upcoming season. In the first half of the year, product sales were just $2.1 billion at the company.\\', \\'Plenty of uncertainties lie ahead, given that this is the first season COVID vaccines will transition to a commercial endemic market, Moderna’s chief commercial officer Arpa Garay acknowledged on the company’s second-quarter earnings call.\\', \\'Previously, Moderna had predicted that demand for COVID shots would reach about 50 million doses in the U.S. this fall. But using flu shots as a proxy, Garay noted that the volume could reach 100 million doses.\\', \"Moderna also needs to compete with Pfizer-BioNTech, whose rival shot appears to be more popular. Nearly 404 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were administered in the U.S., compared with nearly 253 million for Moderna\\'s vaccine, according to the CDC’s COVID vaccination tracker updated in May.\", \\'For this season, the starting pistol has already been fired. The FDA on Monday approved the XBB.1.5 shots by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, and the CDC on Tuesday recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get the updated vaccines this fall.\\']',\n",
       " \"['The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wants to reset expectations for flu vaccines to correct falling uptake.

More than 100 children, most of whom were not vaccinated, died after catching influenza during the 2022-23 flu season and studies have found infection during pregnancy can cause severe illness and lead to negative outcomes including a reduction in birth weight. Yet, vaccine use has fallen in both demographic groups since the start of the pandemic.', 'The CDC, which has tracked a 16.6 percentage point drop in vaccine use in pregnancy, has responded to the trends with its “Wild to Mild” campaign. The message is based on evidence that breakthrough cases have people concerned about vaccine effectiveness and that many people are unaware shots can lessen symptoms even if they fail to prevent infections.', 'With the focus groups suggesting that the potential for vaccines to lessen symptoms resonates with the public, the CDC has created a series of graphics about how flu shots can make infections go from “Wild to Mild.” Each of the graphics features a wild animal, such as a bear or a lion, and a cuter, less-threatening equivalent, such as a cuddly toy or a kitten.', 'The CDC settled on the approach after consumer testing found the message “was well received across parents and pregnant people, as it challenged the belief that flu vaccine is meant to prevent flu and reset expectations around flu vaccine.” Many people who viewed the information perceived it to be “truthful” and “realistic” and the honesty translated into “elevated impressions of CDC.”', 'Having settled on the concept for the digital campaign, the CDC plans to spread the message through paid ad placements, organic social media content, “microinfluencer partnerships” and other activities.']\",\n",

GSK’s mRNA vaccine collaboration with CureVac and the company’s appetite for additional M&A deals were also included.\", \\' \\', \\'Background: After an initial setback with their mRNA COVID vaccine, GSK and partner CureVac came back a few days ago with positive preliminary data for their modified COVID and flu shots. But the question is, with entrenched mRNA players Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, is there any room left for another COVID shot?\\', \"Miels: “For COVID? Limited. But I think the real interest is in the COVID-flu combination, where I think there is a sizable market opportunity.” Under the deal structure, GSK would capture 90% of the asset’s value. If the mRNA COVID-flu vaccines are successful, the whole COVID market and “a large part” of the flu shot market will covert to the combo because “people prefer one shot instead of two.” To convince people to convert, the COVID component of the combo needs to be “as good as or better than current options.” As for the flu element, the mRNA technology allows for longer time to study the flu season to better choose the dominant strain for the vaccine construct. It also allows for more strains to be included than the current quadrivalent options. MRNA vaccines\\' tolerability profile could be a challenge in the flu setting, but there\\'s “heavy overlap” between COVID and flu shots takers.\", \\' \\', \"Background: GSK\\'s application for an RSV vaccine for adults 60 years and older is under FDA priority review, with a decision expected by May 3. Pfizer has a candidate targeting the same population also under priority review for a verdict in May. Furthermore, Pfizer touted positive data for its maternal vaccine to protect newborns, but GSK\\'s maternal effort hit a safety hiccup.\", \"Miels: GSK will initially focus on high-risk individuals for the RSV launch. There are “a lot of parallels” between RSV and shingles in that vaccine makers need to create an “explained demand” because no RSV preventive solutions were available. But awareness is increasing, and COVID taught people with underlying diseases that they are also at a higher risk of developing serious complications from respiratory diseases, and they could therefore be motivated to get an RSV shot. GSK hopes RSV vaccines could match the penetration levels seen with flu shots. Between the two populations, older adults currently represent a bigger market than newborns. (During the Q&A session after GSK\\'s presentation at JPM, Miels said doctors see “distinct difference” between Pfizer\\'s and GSK\\'s candidates in high-risk patients. The “biggest variable” in its competition with Pfizer right now, Miels said, is whether a vaccine could offer protection longer than one year, and GSK expects to have data on that before its final payer discussions in June.)\", \\' \\', \"Background: GSK\\'s oncology ambition took a serious hit late 2022 when Blenrep failed as a monotherapy in a confirmatory phase 3 trial. GSK immediately pulled the BCMA-targeted agent\\'s accelerated approval at FDA’s request but put up a bold front for its two phase 3 trials testing a lower Blenrep dose in combinations. Readouts are expected in the first half. Also in blood cancer, GSK’s application for JAK inhibitor momelotinib in myelofibrosis is awaiting an FDA decision by June 16. GSK got momelotinib from its $1.9 billion acquisition of Sierra Oncology last year and, at the time, touted the med\\'s fit with Blenrep in hematology.\", \\'Miels: GSK has kept the commercial team behind Blenrep in place for a potential momelotinib approval. About 75% of multiple myeloma doctors also treat myelofibrosis. With Blenrep, the problem is about finding the right dose. The FDA has told GSK the original monotherapy dosage is too high. The soon-to-report DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 combo trials could find the optimal dose for Blenrep, and GSK looks to reintroduce the drug if trials are positive.\\', \\' \\', \"Background: The FDA recently took issue with concerning patient survival data coming from PARP inhibitors in some ovarian cancer settings. As part of the classwide scrutiny, GSK pulled a Zejula late-line indication and narrowed its second-line maintenance use to just ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations. Despite a broad label in all ovarian cancer patients who\\'ve responded to initial chemotherapy treatment, Zejula has mostly only been able to reach patients without homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), while AstraZeneca and Merck\\'s Lynparza continues to hold the lion\\'s share of the HRD-positive market—more specifically, the BRCA-mutant subgroup—in the first-line maintenance setting.\", \"Miels: The label reduction affects 20% of Zejula\\'s sales. But it also allows GSK to have another discussion with physicians to try to convince them to use Zejula early in the first-line setting to reap the maximum benefit for patients. The “bulk of physicians” don\\'t extrapolate results in the later-line trials to newly diagnosed patients, and they recognize patient crossovers are a big problem that could muddy the results to the Zejula arm\\'s detriment. Zejula currently captures 50% of new patient starts in first-line maintenance treatment. In doctors\\' minds, the GSK drug is perceived more as a therapy for nonmutant cases. Lynparza\\'s overall survival data, longer time on the market and broader indications in multiple tumor types make doctors\\' positive opinions toward Lynparza “difficult to dislodge,” and the current market dynamics will likely stay “static.” GSK also expects a 2023 readout from an adaptive phase 3 trial called FIRST that tests Zejula in combination with GSK\\'s PD-1 inhibitor Jemperli. The study has a very low chance of being successful because ovarian cancer isn\\'t immunogenic. But if that study turns out positive, “that could change people\\'s mind” of Zejula.\", \\' \\', \"Background: GSK recently showed that Jemperli could match up to Keytruda in their respective combinations with chemo in newly diagnosed nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in the phase 2 PERLA trial. Data on tumor shrinkage and delaying tumor progression actually favored Jemperli, though the trial wasn\\'t powered to show statistically significant superiority. Separately, in a small academic-sponsored trial readout that somehow captured the attention of the likes of The New York Times, Jemperli eradicated tumors in all 14 patients with mismatch repair-deficient locally advanced rectal cancer. The results, while not actionable from a regulatory standpoint, could potentially boost Jemperli\\'s competitive edge as a latecomer in the crowded PD-1/L1 space.\", \"Miels: “We\\'re not expecting to replace [Keytruda] in the first line. But we did [the PERLA trial], because we wanted to validate in physicians\\' minds and the FDA\\'s mind that these are comparable.” Those data could help change Jemperli\\'s prescriber base, and PERLA offers GSK a clinical and regulatory pathway to get further approvals for Jemperli in combinations with TIGIT and CD96 inhibitors. Currently, most Jemperli use is in second-line endometrial cancer, but GSK expects a phase 3 readout in first-line endometrial cancer in the first quarter.\", \\' \\', \\'Background: The novel HIF-PHI class of oral drugs for anemia in CKD once bore high hopes to displace erythropoietin stimulating agents. But safety signals have derailed two agents, and now it’s up to GSK’s daprodustat. The FDA once again raised cardiovascular safety concerns around daprodustat. During an advisory committee meeting, FDA’s external experts voted in favor of the GSK drug in dialysis-dependent anemic CKD patients but recommended against it in nondialysis population.\\', \\'Miels: If dapro is approved only in dialysis patients, GSK doesn’t plan to run any additional trials to try to resurrect the nondialysis indication. In that scenario, GSK’s commercialization strategy will focus on contracting with dialysis providers. If, in the low chance that dapro also receives an approval in the nondialysis population, it will be a “classical cardiometabolic product launch,” including field force detailing.\\', \\' \\', \\'Background: GSK narrowed its focus on innovative medicines and vaccines with the spinoff of consumer health venture Haleon. The new GSK’s M&A moves have therefore become a focus among investors. Apart from striking licensing deals like that with CureVac, GSK bought Sierra Oncology for $1.9 billion and took in pneumococcal vaccine developer Affinivax in a deal worth up to $3.3 billion.\\', \\'Miels: GSK will continue to look for acquisitions in that ballpark. Sierra is a great “template deal” for GSK; i.e., in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. “My preference is to do a whole series of deals in that range.” The size may be bigger, “but you’re not going to see us going out and doing Horizon-type transactions.” (In the largest biopharma deal of 2022, Amgen will purchase Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion.) GSK is agnostic about therapeutic areas, but the company intends to focus more on late-stage assets.\\']',\n",

It registered more approvals (three) than any company in 2022 and each with peak sales potential in the $4 billion range.\\', \\'Another company that scored big in 2022 was bluebird bio with a pair of gene therapies—Skysona and Zynteglo—approved a month apart. Upon approval of the one-time treatments, bluebird made waves by pricing them at $3 million and $2.8 million, respectively.\\', \\'But in November, CSL Behring and uniQure trumped them with a $3.5 million price tag for their newly endorsed gene therapy, Hemgenix. \\', \"What were some of the other impactful approvals of 2022? Eli Lilly\\'s nod for Mounjaro could be a game changer for diabetes and obesity patients, not to mention the windfall it could produce for the company as it squares off against Novo Nordisk\\'s Ozempic and Wegovy.\", \\'Alnylam won a key approval for Amvuttra, a gene silencer to treat hereditary ATTR amyloidosis.

       " '[\\'The FDA’s August authorization of omicron-busting booster vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna raised eyebrows because the decisions were based on animal studies. The lack of human data added another wrinkle to the increasingly stubborn COVID-19 vaccine market.\\', \\'Now, Moderna is rounding out its case with results from testing its updated vaccine in people—and the data also vouches for the shot against an emerging coronavirus mutation, too. In a phase 2/3 trial of more than 500 adults, Moderna’s bivalent booster mRNA 1273.222 triggered a “significantly higher” immune response against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants compared to an auxiliary dose of the company’s standard vaccine, mRNA-1273, which bears the commercial moniker Spikevax.\\', \\'While the data “appear encouraging on first look,” there are several caveats surrounding the effectiveness of both Pfizer and Moderna’s re-tooled shots, according to a note from Bloomberg Intelligence, posted on Twitter.\\', \\'Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sam Fazeli flagged the fact that Moderna’s study “lack[s] disclosure of antibody titers for the control.” Fazeli also highlighted the fact that those given the bivalent booster had had their previous shot 9.5 months before versus 4.5 months for Spikevax. This gave the bivalent patients more time to “naturally develop more effective antibodies against BA.4/5.”\\', \\'The results come shortly after Moderna published data in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a separate, BA.1-targeting bivalent vaccine—mRNA 1273.214—elicited a superior immune response against BA.1, BA.4 and BA.5 versus Spikevax classic, with that greater protection lasting at least three months.\\', \\'Uncertainties aside, Moderna could certainly use the booster win. After a turbulent third quarter of production and safety “pain points,” the company in early November trimmed its annual sales forecast for Spikevax from $21 billion to a range of $18 billion to $19 billion. For the third three months of the year, Spikevax brought home $3.12 billion, below Wall Street’s expectations and down 35% from the same period in 2021.\\', \\'Still, Moderna continues to hold out hope for a booster-fueled sales rebound in 2022’s fourth quarter. And while the extra two months it took Moderna to generate its in-human BA.4/5 results gave the virus more time to evolve, the company’s tweaked shot also appears to hold its own against the latest subvariant in the U.S.\\', \\'In an assay-based exploratory analysis of 40 subjects, both of Moderna’s updated bivalent boosters charted “robust” neutralizing activity against the omicron descendent BQ.1.1, which is now the second-most prominent incarnation of the virus in the U.S. behind BA.5, according to the CDC. Still, the vaccines’ effects were notably diminished against BQ.1.1, with Moderna recording an approximately five-fold drop in titers versus BA.4/BA.5.\\', \\'\"Further study will be needed to confirm the findings in the preliminary analysis, but the initial results indicate robust neutralizing antibody response against BQ.1.1,\" a Moderna spokesperson said over email. \"These data suggest mRNA-1273.222 may continue to provide superior protection against emerging COVID-19 variants including BQ.1.1. into the winter compared to the original Spikevax.\"\\', \\'The fact that Moderna’s updated shot could continue to offer protection as the virus evolves might spur greater uptake of the boosters against COVID-19, which “remains a leading cause of hospitalization and death globally,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement.\\', \\'\"As a new variant of COVID-19 becomes dominant in the U.S., and other respiratory viruses co-circulate this winter, it will be more important than ever for vulnerable populations to get boosted to protect themselves from severe outcomes associated with COVID-19,\" the company\\\\\\'s spokesperson said.\\', \"With regards to specific promotion plans in light of the data, Moderna\\'s spokesperson said the company plans to share the results with global regulators and journals for peer review.\", \\'\"We are also continuing to work closely with public health authorities to disseminate our data and encourage the general public to get boosted as we enter peak respiratory virus season,\" she added.\\', \"The company\\'s comments come as use of the latest COVID-19 boosters in the U.S. remains stuck in the doldrums, with CDC data showing just 10% of people 5 years and older have received one of the updated shots.\", \\'Moderna and Pfizer both won FDA emergency nods for their updated shots this summer, though at the time, some critics took issue with the speed at which the prophylactics passed muster with regulators.

GSK’s chief executive Emma Walmsley said on a call with journalists that the company “intends to be competitive” with its late-stage shot, while Pfizer’s chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten, M.D., Ph.D., told Barron’s that “efficacy [between Pfizer and GSK’s shots] look somewhat similar,” but “if you look at our tolerability, [it] was among the best vaccines you ever can see.”\", \\'“Obviously, it’s a competitive situation,” explained Walmsley on the call in response to a journalist’s question about its rivalry with Pfizer, as both look to have their RSV jabs approved next year. “I would say that I don’t think that’s a bad thing at all, especially when we have the very high confidence we do in the profile of our vaccine. It’s not a bad thing at all in a new market to have more than one competitor.”\\', \\'GSK had hoped to develop a vaccine for both infants and those 60 years and older, but a safety concern in its maternal vaccine trial scuppered the plans for the former. Walmsley said in the call, however, that “in older adults, [RSV infection] is much more significant to hospitalization than it is for babies,\" and therefore that market will be bigger for any company. \\', \"Pfizer said this week that it expects to go to the FDA with its RSV shot for older adults and in maternal use by year\\'s end. The vaccine\\'s phase 3 read out in infants came out just this week and was broadly positive, with the Pharma linking the administration of its bivalent RSV prefusion vaccine candidate RSVpreF, also known as PF-06928316, during pregnancy to a significant reduction in the rate of severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness (MA-LRTI) in newborns.\", \\'However, the study came up short against the second co-primary endpoint, which looked at the effect of RSVpreF on the rate of all severities of MA-LRTI. \\', \\'The adult market, however, may be the bigger prize. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are up to 120,000 hospitalizations among adults 65 years and older with RSV in the U.S. each year, and up to 10,000 of them die. Among children under 5, the CDC says that there are around 58,000 annual hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths.\\', \\'Pfizer’s CEO Albert Bourla, Ph.D., was bullish on his company’s RSV hopeful. “I think we will be the leaders in this market,” he told Barron’s, given that his is the only company to gun for an RSV vaccine with both maternal and older adults usage. \\', \\'Bourla did, however, in the interview reject the idea that the RSV vaccine market could be commoditized, with vaccines competing with each other on pricing. “I don’t think that in modern high-tech vaccines there is a price war or commoditized markets,” he said. “They are priced accordingly to their value, and then someone will get the big markets, or someone will get the small.”\\', \"While GSK has a long history of vaccine development and launches, Pfizer\\'s experience with its pneumonia shots and most recently with its BioNTech-partnered COVID vaccine Comirnaty will clearly also be of major help if it gets approval for its RSV shot. RSV is, however, a very different market. With COVID, the world was waiting on tenterhooks for a shot, but getting the right awareness and education about RSV vaccines will be a more complex campaign for both companies. \", \\'The other major COVID vaccine player in the U.S., Moderna, is also looking to get into the RSV vaccine market but is further back compared to Pfizer and GSK. Moderna entered phase 3 testing this year for its mRNA candidate.\\', \\'AstraZeneca and Sanofi, meanwhile, are developing a long-acting antibody designed for all infants for protection against RSV disease from birth through their first RSV season with a single dose. Monoclonal antibodies do not work as vaccines, as they do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer timely, rapid and direct protection against the disease. AstraZeneca and Sanofi expect FDA submission acceptance in Q4 2022. This will be the main competitor for Pfizer, should the vaccine nab U.S. approval.\\']',\n",

After setting a highly ambitious goal of producing 300 million doses in 2020, the effort produced barely 100 million.\\', \\'In his upcoming book, Warp Speed: Inside the Operation that Beat COVID, the Critics, and the Odds, Paul Mango discusses—with some interesting revelations—the manufacturing constraints that the operation faced and why the pledge proved unrealistic. Mango, the former deputy chief of staff at HHS, followed the agency’s chief Alex Azar when he took a major role with Warp Speed.\\', \\'In the summer of 2020, when Warp Speed identified six vaccine candidates to pursue, the team kicked off a massive manufacturing scale-up from 27 facilities that either were starting from scratch or had to be expanded for vaccine production.\\', \\'No expense was spared. For example, when 2,000-liter vats—used in the manufacture of bulk substance for vaccines—were needed in the U.S., a producer in Switzerland said it had extras on hand and could deliver them by ship in six weeks. But General Gus Perna of Warp Speed—by way of the Army Materiel Command—had an alternate solution.\\', \\'“I’ll have military aircraft there tomorrow, so get ready to load,” Perna said, as Mango recalled in a recent interview with Fierce Pharma.\\', \\'The immediate lack of equipment and raw materials needed to produce the vaccines early in the pandemic has been well documented. But according to Mango, the biggest impediment to a quick scale-up was the lack of trained labor.\\', \\'Warp Speed’s manufacturing guru Carlo de Notaristefani, formerly the CEO at Teva, was fully aware of the potential problems posed by the human element in a quick scale up and warned of it.\\', \\'“In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the typical approach is to perfect each step in the process and then pull it all together and when you do that, it never works like it’s designed to,” Mango said. “Carlo said, ‘99% of the time, it’s some worker, some trained technician who doesn’t follow procedure. That’s why we get ourselves in trouble with contamination.’ And by the way, that happened along the way.”\\', \\'Mango’s reference, of course, was to the high-profile errors made at Emergent’s Baltimore plant, where millions of doses Johnson & Johnson vaccines had to be discarded because of cross contamination. Officials warned Emergent—which was producing both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines—of the potential for mistakes, Mango said.\\', \\'For its part, Emergent maintains that Operation Warp Speed, FDA and other government officials were onsite on multiple occasions and were engaged in production decisions.\\', \\'\"Despite the risks that were discussed and well-known by all parties, including the federal government, OWS officials directed Emergent to move forward with tech-transferring and scaling up commercial production of two novel coronavirus vaccine candidates in the facility, due to the pressing needs of the pandemic,\" an Emergent spokesman said.\\', \\'In addition, Warp Speed officials concluded that the concept of holding a facility in reserve—as the United States had done for a decade with Emergent—was flawed, Mango said. Their advice for the future was to have an active vaccine plant with excess capacity up and running with a trained workforce that can be flexed to add capacity. The site could be audited, tested and trained annually to ensure its readiness.\\', \\'“It’s too expensive to just have an idle plant,” Mango said. \\', \\'Emergent agrees that the program was not executed as it was designed. \\', \\'\"The initial plan for the [Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing] was for readiness for the production of only 50 million doses of flu vaccine over a four-month period, nowhere near the hundreds of millions of vaccine doses required by the pandemic,\" Emergent\\\\\\'s spokesman said. \"But even under the original concept, the government never delivered the drug development work necessary to build capacity, develop a skilled workforce, and maintain an adequate state of readiness at any of the CIADM facilities.\"\\', \\'Another company that didn’t deliver, Mango said, was Pfizer. The company came up short on its pledge to supply the U.S. with 40 million doses, blaming manufacturing delays which Warp Speed said it wasn’t apprised of.\\', \"Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment.

It turns out the measures to thwart COVID-19, like mask-wearing and social distancing, work wonders against the annual bug, too. \\', \"But the medical community\\'s flu-fighters were equipped with another weapon that the COVID arsenal didn\\'t have till December: a vaccine. Better equipped than ever, in fact. Flu shot makers delivered a record 194 million doses to the U.S. last season as public health experts warned against the dreaded overlap between the two pathogens. Flu vaccine demand skyrocketed.\", \\'And that delivered hefty sales for flu shot heavyweights Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline and Seqirus at a time when other vaccine revenues sagged. Sanofi led the pack with $2.47 billion in flu shot sales, up 38% compared with 2019, while Seqirus raked in $1.7 billion, up an impressive 30%. England’s GSK raked in £733 million, up 35%.\\', \\'This season, flu shot makers are again gearing up for another record year, with deliveries set to match the historic figures reported in 2020. Despite the widely deployed COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, this flu season could prove just as precarious as society tries to roar back to pre-pandemic life, vaccine execs contend.\\', \\'“A mild season one year may not signal what will occur the following year,” GlaxoSmithKline’s Leonard Friedland, M.D., vice president and director of scientific affairs and public health, told Fierce Pharma in an email. \\', \\'Flu suppliers expect to ship more than 190 million doses during the upcoming season, indicating that “supply likely won’t be an issue,” Friedland said. \\', \\'RELATED: Vaccine maker Seqirus plots $800M investment into major Australian shot manufacturing center\\', \"GSK plans to send more than 50 million doses to the U.S.\\\\u2060—about the same amount it produced in 2020.

The goal was to prevent what was ominously termed a “twindemic,” or the simultaneous influx of flu and coronavirus patients into U.S. hospitals. \\', \\'One year and three authorized COVID-19 jabs later, flu shot makers warn the twindemic isn’t merely a concern of the past. The delta variant has driven a wave of new infections and has sent hospitalizations rising, mostly among the unvaccinated. \\', \"That hasn’t stopped many businesses from returning employees to the office (albeit many with vaccine mandates). Nor has it stopped schools from calling students back to the classroom. But after a year spent largely at home, Americans are returning to society more susceptible to viruses they might have otherwise encountered, Sanofi\\'s DiVito said. \", \\'Case in point: the recent rise of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, DiVito said. The virus, which can cause serious cases of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants, has made an uncharacteristically early return, triggering a CDC health advisory in June. \\', \\'“None of us were exposed to things like flu and RSV that we normally would be each year,” DiVito said. A mix of the delta variant and flu among a naive population “could be a recipe for disaster.” \\', \\'With the White House planning to roll out COVID-19 boosters to the general population as early as September—pending an official nod from regulators—flu shot makers could be in for a tailwind. \\', \\'That’s thanks to the CDC’s decision in early May to do away with its recommendation that people avoid getting another shot within two weeks of the coronavirus vaccine. Intended to bolster lagging routine immunizations among teens, the CDC move means that some Americans may be able to get their annual flu shots and COVID boosters during the same appointment.\\', \\'RELATED: Merck, GSK and Pfizer vaccines get a boost as CDC lifts 2-week restriction on pandemic shots\\', \\'“The availability of vaccines, plus that important guidance from the CDC on coadministration, creates an environment where immunization rates for both flu and COVID should be boosted,” Seqirus’ Ross said in an interview. \\', \\'Sanofi is now trying to push the double-shot method with extra safety evidence.\\', \\'The company kickstarted a mid-stage study this summer that will test the safety of its Fluzone high-dose quadrivalent vaccine alongside a third dose of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine in people aged 65 and older.\\', \"But as flu vaccination season nears, it\\'s not certain the data will be ready ahead of a wide deployment this fall. Regardless, Sanofi believes it\\'s a good idea for healthcare providers to offer both shots simultaneously in the coming months.\", \\'\"If you do these things at the same time, they\\\\\\'re coming in anyway, that\\\\\\'s ideal,\" DiVito said. \"We just have to make sure healthcare providers, the immunizers, view it that way and not like an extra burden.\"\\']',\n",

AZ’s vaccine is the second to snag a green light in the U.K. after Pfizer and BioNTech’s shot.\\', \\'The authorization recommends patients receive two 0.5-ml doses of AZ’s shot at an interval of between four and 12 weeks. It’s the same regimen that boasted 62% efficacy in interim analyses from late-stage trials in the U.K. and Brazil, well below the 90%-plus bar set by Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines.

Trust-building cannot be rushed.\\', \\'So far, participation by minority volunteers in coronavirus trials has increased only slightly compared with typically low levels for other clinical trials—and targeted outreach efforts to recruit more minorities have been slow to launch.\\', \\'Some of that outreach is taking place at historically black colleges and universities, which are trusted institutions for many Black Americans. At Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, researchers have set up in-person meetings with patients they already know. Earlier this month, a half-dozen patients gathered in a cramped conference room on campus. They snacked on turkey sandwiches and potato chips and listened to the pitch from their physician, Dr. Vladimir Berthaud.\\', \\'“What’s the best hope to get rid of this virus?” he asked them.\\', \\'“Vaccination,” they replied.\\', \\'Then Berthaud followed up: “So raise your hand if you would like to take the vaccine?”\\', \\'Some hands shot up, but not all.\\', \\'“I ain’t going to be the first one, now,” said Lanette Hayes.\\', \\'Katrina Thompson said she does eventually want to get a shot for protection against the coronavirus.

Many Black Americans report ongoing mistreatment by medical providers today.\\', \\'Berthaud is recruiting patients for a clinical trial site he will oversee in Nashville, and he would like more than 300 people of color to enroll. Berthaud, who is Black and from Haiti, appeals to his patients’ sense of duty.\\', \\'“If you don’t have enough people like you in those vaccine trials, you will not know if it works for you,” he told them. “You will not know.”\\', \\'For most of the current coronavirus vaccine trials, recruitment mainly takes place online—which often results in mostly white people enrolling.\\', \\'That’s why Meharry researchers are wooing Black patients with a personal invitation.

Mack said there are no shortcuts if medical research is going to reflect the diversity of the U.S. It takes time to build trust and meaningful relationships with people who have endured a history of abuse or neglect by medical providers, and exclusion from biomedical research and decision-making.\\', \\'“Now, that being said, the only thing we can do is what we’re doing,” he said—by which he means respectful, unrushed outreach and dialogue.\\', \\'The primary effort, called the COVID-19 Prevention Network, taps into four existing clinical trial networks designed to advance HIV research.

It will involve seven “faith ambassadors” and 30 “clergy consultants” in the African American community working to dispel myths and increase trust in the clinical trial process. But Sanders cautioned this is not about a hard sell. It’s not his job to preach trial participation from the pulpit, he said.\\', \\'“We are not out beating the drum,” he said, acknowledging that congregants may have legitimate concerns. “I am not going to do anything more than make sure people are able to make an informed choice.”\\', \\'The danger in lunging for big diversity goals is that it could spark a backlash, meaning minorities might be even less willing to participate, said associate professor Rachel Hardeman, who studies health equity at the University of Minnesota. It’s important that the doctors doing the asking look like the people they’re appealing to, she said.\\', \"“It’s racial concordance,” she explained. “It offers this feeling of, ‘You know who I am, you know where I come from, you have my best interests at heart.\\'”\", \\'Historically Black medical institutions in the U.S. are uniquely positioned to do this work. While they haven’t been on the leading edge of recruitment for vaccine trials, they intend to play an important part. The president of Nashville’s Meharry Medical College, Dr. James Hildreth, is an infectious disease researcher. But instead of overseeing the trial site being hosted on his campus, Hildreth has a more modest goal in mind: He plans to participate as a patient, and urge others to join him.\\', \\'“I think my role is more important in advocating for people to be involved in vaccine studies than to be one of the leaders of the study,” he said.\\', \\'So at Meharry, Berthaud is the principal investigator. As lunch wraps up in the crowded conference room, he has managed to win over some holdouts.\\', \\'“Where is the line?” asked Robert Smith. “Where do we sign?”\\', \\'Smith, with his young grandson in tow, didn’t raise his hand at first when asked if he’d take the vaccine.

AstraZeneca, which is running the global trial of the vaccine it produced with the University of Oxford, said the trial volunteer recovered from a severe inflammation of the spinal cord and is no longer hospitalized.', 'AstraZeneca has not confirmed that the patient was afflicted with transverse myelitis, but Nath and another neurologist said they understood this to be the case. Transverse myelitis produces a set of symptoms involving inflammation along the spinal cord that can cause pain, muscle weakness and paralysis. Britain’s regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, reviewed the case and has allowed the trial to resume in the U.K.', 'AstraZeneca “need[s] to be more forthcoming with a potential complication of a vaccine which will eventually be given to millions of people,” said Nath. “We would like to see how we can help, but the lack of information makes it difficult to do so.”', 'Any decision about whether to continue the trial is complex, because it’s difficult to assess the cause of a rare injury that occurs during a vaccine trial—and because scientists and authorities have to weigh the risk of uncommon side effects against a vaccine that might curb the pandemic.', '“So many factors go into these decisions,” Nath said. “I’m sure everything is on the table. The last thing you want to do is hurt healthy people.”', 'The NIH has yet to get tissue or blood samples from the British patient, and its investigation is “in the planning stages,” Nath said. U.S. scientists could look at samples from other vaccinated patients to see whether any of the antibodies they generated in response to the coronavirus also attack brain or spinal cord tissue.', 'Such studies might take a month or two, he said. The FDA declined to comment on how long it would take before it decides whether to move forward.', 'Jesse Goodman, M.D., a Georgetown University professor and physician who was chief scientist and lead vaccine regulator at the FDA during the Obama administration, said the agency will review the data and possibly consult with British regulators before allowing resumption of the U.S. study, which had just begun when the injury was reported. Two other coronavirus vaccines are also in late-stage trials in the U.S.', 'If it determines the injury in the British trial was caused by the vaccine, the FDA could pause the trial. If it allows it to resume, regulators and scientists surely will be on the watch for similar symptoms in other trial participants.', 'A volunteer in an earlier phase of the AstraZeneca trial experienced a similar side effect, but investigators discovered she had multiple sclerosis that was unrelated to the vaccination, according to Elliot Frohman, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology Center at the University of Texas.', 'Neurologists who study illnesses like transverse myelitis say they are rare—occurring at a rate of perhaps 1 in 250,000 people—and strike most often as a result of the body’s immune response to a virus. Less frequently, such episodes have also been linked to vaccines.', 'The precise cause of the disease is key to the decision by authorities whether to resume the trial. Sometimes an underlying medical condition is “unmasked” by a person’s immune response to the vaccine, leading to illness, as happened with the MS patient. In that case, the trial might be continued without fear, because the illness was not specific to the vaccine.', 'More worrisome is a phenomenon called “molecular mimicry.” In such cases, some small piece of the vaccine may be similar to tissue in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in an immune attack on that tissue in response to a vaccine component. Should that be the case, another occurrence of transverse myelitis would be likely if the trial resumed, said William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A second case would shut down the trial, he said.', 'In 1976, a massive swine flu vaccination program was halted when doctors began diagnosing a similar disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), in people who received the vaccine. At the time no one knew how common GBS was, so it was difficult to tell whether the episodes were related to the vaccine.', 'Eventually, scientists found that the vaccine increased the risk of the disorder by an additional one case among every 100,000 vaccinated patients. Typical seasonal flu vaccination raises the risk of GBS in about one additional case in every 1 million people.', '“It’s very, very hard” to determine if one rare event was caused by a vaccine, Schaffner said. “How do you attribute an increased risk for something that occurs in one in a million people?”', 'Before allowing U.S. trials to restart, the FDA will want to see why the company and an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) in the U.K. felt it was safe to continue, Goodman said. The AstraZeneca trial in the U.S. has a separate safety board.', 'FDA officials will need to review full details of the case and may request more information about the affected study volunteer before deciding whether to allow the U.S. trial to continue, Goodman said. They may also require AstraZeneca to update the safety information it provides to study participants.', 'It’s possible that the volunteer’s health problem was a coincidence unrelated to the vaccine, said Amesh Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Studies aren’t usually stopped over a single health problem, even if it’s serious.', 'Yet many health leaders have expressed frustration that AstraZeneca hasn’t released more information about the health problem that led it to halt its U.K. trial.', '“There is just so little information about this that it’s impossible to understand what the diagnosis was or why the DSMB and sponsor were reassured” that it was safe to continue, Goodman said.', 'AstraZeneca has said it’s unable to provide more information about the health problem, saying this would violate patient privacy, although it didn’t say how.', 'But there’s an exceptional need for transparency in a political climate rife with vaccine hesitancy and mistrust of the Trump administration’s handling of the COVID-19 response, leading scientists say.', '“While I respect the critical need for patient confidentiality, I think it would be really helpful to know what their assessment of these issues was,” Goodman said. “What was the diagnosis? If there wasn’t a clear diagnosis, what is it that led them to feel the trial could be restarted? There is so much interest and potential concern about a COVID-19 vaccine that the more information that can be provided, the more reassuring that would be.”', 'The FDA will need to balance any possible risks from an experimental vaccine with the danger posed by COVID-19, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans.', '“There are also potential consequences if you stop a study,” Goodman said.', 'If the AstraZeneca vaccine fails, the U.S. government is supporting six other COVID-19 vaccines in the hope at least one will succeed. The potential problems with the AstraZeneca vaccine show this to be a wise investment, Adalja said.', '“This is part of the idea of not having just one vaccine candidate going forward,” he said. “It gives you a little more insurance.”', 'Schaffner said researchers need to remember that vaccine research is unpredictable.', '“The investigators have inadvisedly been hyping their own vaccine,” Schaffner said. “The Oxford investigators were out there this summer saying, ‘We’re going to get there first.’ But this is exactly the sort of reason … Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and the rest of us have been saying, ‘You never know what will happen once you get into large-scale human trials.’”', 'This KHN story first published on California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.', 'KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

In that case, researchers would have “a moral obligation” to end the trial early and make the active vaccine available to everyone in the study, including those who had been given placebos—and accelerate the process to give the vaccine to millions.', 'Fauci’s comments come at a time of growing concern about whether political pressure from the Trump administration could influence federal regulators and scientists overseeing the nation’s response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, and erode shaky public confidence in vaccines. Prominent vaccine experts have said they fear Trump is pushing for an early vaccine approval to help win reelection.', 'Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he trusts the independent members of the DSMB—who are not government employees—to hold vaccines to high standards without being politically influenced.

So far, only about 1 in 5 trial participants are Black or Hispanic. Given that Blacks and Hispanics have been hit harder than other groups by the pandemic, Topol said, it’s important that they make up a larger part of vaccine trials.', 'Ending vaccine trials early also carries safety risks, said Paul Offit, M.D., a vaccine developer who serves on an NIH advisory panel on COVID vaccines and treatments.', 'A smaller, shorter trial could fail to detect important vaccine side effects, which could become apparent only after millions of people have been immunized, said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.', 'Researchers will continue to follow vaccinated volunteers for a full year to look for long-term side effects, Redfield said.', 'And Fauci acknowledged that cutting a trial short could undermine public confidence in COVID vaccines.

The vaccine brought in just £323 million ($419 million) in the second quarter after COVID-19 lockdown measures impeded doctor visits and hurt vaccination rates especially in the U.S., GSK said Wednesday.\\', \"Because of lower demand, the vaccine is no longer listed on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s (CDC’s) shortage roster. Plus, GSK now has the bandwidth to support an official launch in China at the end of June, more than a year after its approval in the emerging market, where an estimated 1.56 million cases of shingles occur each year in people 50 years and above.\", \\'Shingrix isn’t the only GSK vaccine that suffered during the pandemic. Overall, GSK’s vaccines business saw a year-over-year decline of 29%, to £1.13 billion ($1.47 billion) in the second quarter as products for DTPa, hepatitis and meningitis all declined sharply.\\', \\'Pediatric vaccination is now back to pre-COVID-19 levels, while adolescent and adult immunization—such as that for Shingrix—remains further behind, GSK CEO Emma Walmsley said during a conference on Wednesday.\\', \\'“Despite lockdown impact on vaccination rates, we believe the underlying demand for our key vaccines, including shingles and meningitis, remains very strong,” Walmsley said. “Guidance from government agencies, including the CDC, is emphasizing the importance of routine immunizations and catch-up for all age groups.” While GSK expects vaccination to recover, Walmsley acknowledged the timing is uncertain.\\', \\'RELATED: The top 15 pharma companies by 2026 sales | 8.

The vaccine combines GSK’s pandemic vaccine adjuvant AS03 with Sanofi’s recombinant DNA platform. The use of an adjuvant could potentially reduce the dosing required to induce an immune response, allowing drugmakers to deliver more shots, GSK argues.\\', \\'GSK aims to produce 1 billion doses of the adjuvant in 2021, Walmsley said. The company’s offering the booster to at least seven experimental shots against the novel coronavirus.\\', \"COVID-19 may have already boosted one part of GSK\\'s business, though. As a highly infectious respiratory disease, it’s especially threatening to patients with existing respiratory conditions.

GSK is waiting for an FDA decision on expanding Trelegy’s use in asthma, but AstraZeneca’s rival triplet Breztri just won a go-ahead to compete in COPD.\\', \\'Meanwhile, GSK’s HIV products declined 2% to £1.19 billion in the second quarter, partly due to unwinding the COVID-19 stockpiling that drove up first-quarter sales. GSK is counting on its newer two-drug regimens to challenge Gilead’s leading position in HIV. In the second quarter, two dual-drug therapies—Juluca and Dovato—contributed £181 million to GSK’s top line, in line with consensus.\\', \\'Although the pandemic has slowed patient-switching and new diagnosis, the two meds still managed to increase new-to-brand market share to 9% in the U.S., Walmsley said, adding that the company expects the speed will accelerate when the health situation normalizes.\\', \\'Besides, the company has resubmitted its application for long-acting two-drug injectable Cabenuva to the FDA and expects a verdict in the first quarter next year. The agency previously declined to approve the med because of manufacturing-related issues.\\', \\'In GSK’s newfound interest, oncology, PARP inhibitor Zejula sold £77 million in the second quarter, about 9% below expectations, a disappointment that GSK pharma chief Luke Miels attributed to inventory shifts.\\', \\'All told, GSK’s second-quarter group sales were £7.6 billion, having dropped 10% at constant currencies on a pro-forma basis—that is, counting Pfizer’s consumer health portfolio as if it were already part of GSK the same period last year. It maintained its full-year guidance for adjusted earnings but warned that its numbers depend on the timing of recovery in vaccination rates.\\']',\n",

The board will alert the NIH and vaccine maker if it sees surprising data — either dangerous side effects or powerful efficacy. Some fear that if the vaccine seems to work in an early review, the FDA would be pressured to stop the trial.', 'Offit said NIH should not accept anything less than a completed trial of 30,000 people. Fifty cases “is a very small number” to use as evidence for releasing a vaccine that could be administered to tens of millions, he said.', 'The public might clamor for the release of any vaccine that seemed to work. Moderna said it has already begun producing millions of doses of vaccine “at risk,” banking on the vaccine’s success. The FDA could release those under powers provided when the country declared a public health emergency in March.', 'With more than half the country deeply mistrustful of Trump, according to recent polls, any federal decision could be resisted and lead to widespread rejection of even a promising vaccine.

Hope and desire for a vaccine to end the global devastation is growing with each passing week.', 'Almost every day, I hear people making plans around the eventual arrival of a coronavirus vaccine—office reopenings, rescheduled weddings, family reunions and international travel. In recent weeks, colleagues and friends have asked me with growing urgency: “When will we have a vaccine? Will it be any good?”', 'At the same time, other friends have been telling me, “When I hear that this is going to be the fastest vaccine developed ever, that doesn’t make me feel good—it makes me feel nervous that they’re going to cut corners.”', 'These questions and concerns resonate with me. I, too, want a vaccine, but I want reassurance that it’s truly safe and effective. So I talked to a dozen people in the vaccine world: scientists, pediatricians, pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as staff at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration.', 'Let me tell you this up front: If you’re imagining there’ll be one golden day when a vaccine is approved and the pandemic will be over—Finally! We can all crowd into one another’s living rooms and resume choir practice again!—I’m afraid it won’t be quite like that. But it will be the beginning of the end.', 'There’s much to be hopeful about, and enormous challenges lie ahead. Let’s dig in.', 'Everyone I spoke to was optimistic that manufacturers would eventually develop a COVID-19 vaccine. This isn’t just because there are so many scientists and pharmaceutical companies working on the endeavor, and so much money being poured into it, though that also raises the chance of success.', 'The goal of vaccine developers is to mimic a natural infection as closely as possible without getting a healthy individual sick. There are many ways to do this. You can give a person a weakened virus or a dead virus. You can also show the immune system just part of the virus. Many manufacturers are creating vaccines involving only the “spike protein,” the part on the surface of the coronavirus that attaches to the human cell it is trying to enter. Once the immune system has learned what the spike protein looks like, when it encounters it again, as part of a real coronavirus, it should know how to defend itself.', 'John Mascola, M.D., director of the Vaccine Research Center at the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he is hopeful because our natural immune system, when healthy, is capable of handling the infection. “Most of the time, people recover from COVID-19, because their immune system eventually clears the virus,” he said. He contrasted the coronavirus to HIV, for which scientists so far have struggled to create an effective vaccine: “In HIV, the natural immune system is not effective and people get AIDS.” In this virus’s case, if we can mimic a natural infection closely enough, it’s likely that a vaccine will work.', 'There are some vaccines that are extremely effective, like the MMR vaccine: One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles; two doses (which is what’s recommended) are about 97% effective.', 'Other vaccines aren’t as perfect. The flu shot’s effectiveness varies year to year. During the 2019-20 flu season, it was about 45% effective at preventing infections, according to the CDC. The year before, it was just 29% effective.', 'The experts I talked to said that the flu shot was an outlier because of the rapidly shifting nature of the influenza virus. Because of its frequent mutations, developers have to make each year’s vaccine based on educated guesses on what strains of the flu virus will be circulating next year. Sometimes, they misjudge, resulting in a vaccine that doesn’t exactly match up with the flu strains that are most prevalent the following season.', '“Influenza changes year in, year out, and the people who get it tend to be extremes in age—elderly and children—so you don’t tend to have as good an immune response,” said Nicholas Kartsonis, M.D., infectious disease and vaccines clinical research lead for Merck, which has two COVID-19 vaccine candidates that it plans to start in human trials this year.', 'One lucky break COVID-19 vaccine developers have had is that this coronavirus hasn’t mutated in any significant way so far, including, crucially, the part that is most visible to the immune system, that spike protein. So long as that remains true, the vaccine they make should match up with the virus that our bodies will encounter in the real world, meaning it’ll likely work as intended. Given the stability seen so far in the coronavirus’s genetic sequence, “I am hopeful that when we do develop a vaccine, it will provide long-term protection,” Kartsonis said.', 'When vaccine manufacturers talk about “effective,” there are two common definitions. One is preventing people from getting sick. The other is preventing people from getting infected at all. In the case of COVID-19, this could be a nontrivial difference.', 'We know now that many people infected with the coronavirus may be asymptomatic carriers, which means that they never feel sick or get symptoms like a cough or fever, even if they are, in fact, infected with the virus. So you can have a vaccine that is effective in that it prevents symptomatic COVID-19, but that doesn’t mean it’ll stop everyone from being infected.', 'Let’s be clear: A vaccine that can significantly reduce sickness would be fantastic. If a vaccine can reduce the severity of COVID-19 so that it’s far less deadly, decrease hospitalizations and minimize symptoms even for those who catch it, that’s a win.', '“In terms of what you’d expect for approval, it should at least be 50% efficacy against symptoms and 70% against moderate to severe disease, to keep you out of the hospital,” said Paul Offit, M.D., director of the vaccine education center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.', 'Even so, it’s important not only to measure what the vaccine does, but also for politicians, health officials and journalists to clearly explain to the public exactly what it is that the vaccine is capable of doing. If it ends up that the first vaccine to go to market is “70% effective,” we should be clear on whether it is 70% effective at reducing sickness or infection, so members of the public have the appropriate context and don’t feel let down if they are vaccinated and still get a mild case of COVID-19.', 'When experimental vaccines are tested, they usually go through three phases of clinical trials. The first phase is the smallest and focuses on safety, making sure that the product doesn’t have any dangerous health effects. The second is a little larger, continuing to gather safety data while testing if the vaccine can induce an immune response, producing antibodies in participants. The third trial is the largest, and it needs to be big enough to confirm that the vaccine is actually effective in the real world.', 'Moderna Therapeutics is currently expected to be the first U.S. manufacturer to start a phase 3 trial. Candidates by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson will follow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Moderna’s trial is planned to begin in July and will enroll about 30,000 participants. Half will get the vaccine and half will get a placebo, according to Moderna’s chief medical officer Tal Zaks, M.D. (I should disclose: Paul Sagan, chairman of ProPublica’s board, is also one of Moderna’s board members. That said, ProPublica’s board members have no say in what reporters write about, nor do they know about articles before they are published.)', 'The participants will be tracked carefully throughout the study. If they have any symptoms related to COVID-19, they’ll get tested to see if they have contracted the virus. The participants will also get blood drawn at regular intervals to get tested for antibodies, which will determine if they got infected but perhaps didn’t know because they didn’t develop symptoms.', '“But wait!” you say. “Doesn’t a vaccine also create antibodies? How can you tell by looking in a participant’s blood whether the antibodies come from the vaccine or from an infection that the vaccine failed to prevent?” Excellent question.', 'At least for Moderna’s vaccine trial, here’s how they’re going to tell the difference: Moderna’s vaccine is what’s known as an mRNA vaccine. Instead of using the actual virus or even a little bit of the virus, it uses a piece of genetic code, kind of like a recipe, that gives instructions for making the spike protein. Once injected into the arm and introduced into human cells, the cell’s protein-making factories read the recipe and manufacture the spike protein, churning out copies for the immune system to check out. The immune system should then create antibodies that correspond to the spike protein, like a matching puzzle piece.', 'When you get infected by an actual coronavirus, however, there are more parts to it than just the spike protein. Your body will produce other antibodies that match up with other parts of the virus, including what’s called the nucleoprotein, found inside the virus. We can also measure for those antibodies in a trial participant’s blood, the NIH’s Mascola explained. So if we find so-called NP antibodies, that means you’ve been infected for real, because there’s no way you could induce NP antibodies from the vaccine alone.', 'The Moderna trial is designed to end when a predetermined number of people have gotten sick, according to Zaks. Then, the study investigators will count up the number of people that have gotten sick in the placebo arm and compare it with the vaccine arm. Hopefully, there will be far fewer in the vaccinated cohort.', 'There’s one more question that a phase 3 trial cannot answer: How long will protection last? Right now, we don’t even know if people who have gotten sick via natural infection have lifelong immunity. The only way to find out how long a vaccine’s protection lasts will be to keep tracking study participants and whether their antibody levels drop over time. We may end up needing periodic booster shots. Truly, only time will tell.', 'To give you a sense of what a blistering pace we are attempting to move at, consider that under normal circumstances, it typically takes 10 to 15 years (PDF) to develop a vaccine. Creating the HPV vaccine was a 15-year journey from key research findings in 1991 until the vaccine was approved, initially for the prevention of cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers, in 2006. Merck’s Ebola vaccine, one of the fastest ever to be approved, still took about four years from start to finish, according to Kartsonis.', 'The speed of the phase 3 trials depends on the rate of infection wherever people are enrolled. If there is a huge outbreak going on, people in the placebo group will get sick at a high rate, and the trial may be over in a matter of a few months. If infection rates are very low, however, the trial could drag on for months on end. Moderna hasn’t announced its trial sites yet, but it will have sites “well dispersed” in the U.S. and is considering international trials as well, according to a spokesman.', '“There have been some European countries that wanted to be part of our trial, and we said: ‘Look at your epidemiology, you’re a victim of your own success—there’s just not enough cases happening. It would take five years!’” Moderna’s Zaks said. “So speed here is going to be enabled by what we anticipate is ongoing attack rates. We expect there will be infections amongst the participants on our trial.”', 'Still, there have been discussions of some potential ways to speed up trials even more. One common proposal is to conduct what are known as challenge trials, in which vaccinated participants are deliberately “challenged” with the coronavirus to see if they get sick.', 'This idea was dismissed as unethical by some experts I interviewed. “We don’t have a treatment—we can’t guarantee to any volunteer that if we gave them a challenge with the actual virus, that it wouldn’t make them very, very sick,” said William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt Medicine. “That would make a lot of people very uneasy.”', 'The other shortcoming of approving a vaccine via a challenge trial is that because of the inherently risky nature of giving participants a live virus, challenge trials are typically very small. “That diminishes the safety database, and you need a large safety database to give us comfort to communicate to the public that we think that this is a safe vaccine,” Schaffner said.', 'Another potential would be to green light use of a vaccine based on expected benefit, if manufacturers can show it reliably generates levels of antibodies in study participants that are similar to those found in people who have been naturally infected. Not everyone is a fan of that idea—some experts I interviewed told me that immune responses aren’t always predictive of a vaccine’s real-world capabilities. (Read more about this discussion.)', 'In the phase 3 trials currently being planned, the vaccines will be tested in adults. People over the age of 55 are being specifically recruited, and it’s important to include them because the need for the vaccine in that demographic is particularly high.', 'One group that won’t be in the initial set of phase 3 trials: children.', 'This is for two reasons. First, as a safety precaution, the NIH’s Mascola explained. Traditionally, when running trials with an experimental vaccine or drug, developers make sure it’s safe in adults before moving on to children. Second, for the COVID-19 vaccine specifically, the most acute need isn’t in children.', 'This means that when the vaccine is first approved, it likely won’t be available for those under 18, because it hasn’t yet been studied in that population. However, Mascola said there are already discussions for how to run future trials for children. Moderna will eventually run trials in children, Zaks confirmed.', 'Another special population is pregnant women. They are also not going to be enrolled in the initial phase 3 trial for the Moderna vaccine, according to Zaks. But Mascola said that it’s essential that that population eventually be studied. “If we’re not able to immunize women of childbearing age, that excludes a large proportion of the population. There’s a strong interest in getting those studies done,” he said. “The FDA is encouraging companies/sponsors to include in their development plans studies that would provide data to support use of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy,” the agency said in a statement.', 'The FDA added that it “strongly encourages the enrollment of populations most affected by COVID-19, specifically racial and ethnic minorities.” African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, contracting the virus and dying at higher rates.', 'One strategy that everyone agreed was a safe way to save a whole lot of time without any risk to human health is what’s known as “manufacturing at risk.” This is one of the key components of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed, which is supporting five candidates with billions of dollars of federal funding.', 'Typically, drugmakers will manufacture only enough doses for clinical trials and make sure the trials are successful before starting mass production. Manufacturing at risk means that developers will instead begin mass production at the same time as clinical trials, which means that if a vaccine fails in human trials, they’ll have to throw away all the product they’ve made, wasting money and materials. But if a product is successful, it means that the minute its trial is completed, there’ll be millions of doses ready to go.', 'Manufacturing at a massive scale is no simple task. “If we’re going to immunize 300 million people in the U.S.—we don’t even do that with the flu vaccine every year—we need a lot of glass vials, we have to make sure we have printing supplies and paper to make the labels and package inserts, we need stoppers for the vials, and they all need to be made to a very high standard. All this in addition to the raw materials to the vaccine itself,” Schaffner said.', 'Pfizer and its partner, German company BioNTech, are planning to have a few million doses ready by the end of the year, and hundreds of millions of doses available in 2021, even though the first of their four vaccine candidates just began its first early-stage human trials in May. The companies are currently preparing manufacturing facilities in St. Louis, Andover, Massachusetts, and Kalamazoo, Michigan, as well as in Europe, according to Philip Dormitzer, M.D., Ph.D., Pfizer’s vice president and chief scientific officer for viral vaccines.', 'On the day that a vaccine is approved, you’ll find me jumping up and down in my apartment, cheering loudly enough to startle my neighbors. And then … I’ll keep on washing my hands, wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing.', 'Why? Because I know that when a vaccine is first approved by the FDA, there won’t be enough available for everyone who wants it. There will need to be a prioritization, with the vaccine given first to those who need it most: essential workers and the elderly. As a healthy adult who is fortunate to be able to work from home, I’ll be nowhere near the front of the inoculation line.', 'Distribution is going to be a massive challenge. “There’s a need to have in place a mechanism to ensure people who should get the vaccine get it,” Walter Orenstein, M.D., associate director of Emory University’s vaccine center, said. “We won’t have 8 billion vaccines. So who should get priority, and how should it get delivered? We will need to remove barriers to access, including cost and distance.”', 'In all likelihood, we’ll have several vaccines that come to market and are in use at the same time, because of the unprecedented need to vaccinate so many people around the globe. No one company has the manufacturing capability to make it all.', 'There may also be differences in what works best for different countries and populations. Some of the vaccines will require cold shipping or storage. Some will require two doses (Moderna’s is a two-dose vaccine, taken a month apart). All these variations will add to the complexity of delivery and distribution.', '“Since I have gray hair, I’m trying to remind my colleagues that in previous distribution and prioritization schemes, flexibility is very important,” Schaffner warned me. He has long worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice, which reviews data on vaccines and gives recommendations on which populations they should be used for. He is now on the COVID-19 vaccine working group. “Adverse events will come up that have to become investigated. There will be bumps in the road. War plans are great, until the war starts. Then you will have to be flexible.”', 'Vaccinating 15,000 to 20,000 people before approval should give regulators a large pool of data to help them understand what side effects are to be expected and help ensure that the vaccines that go to market don’t have any major safety issues.', 'But of course, 20,000 people isn’t 20 million or 200 million or 2 billion people.', '“When we have tens of thousands of people being evaluated, we can at least pick up safety signals for serious adverse events for the more frequent adverse events,” Orenstein said. “Now for very rare events, if it’s 1 per million, you’re not going to catch that in clinical trials.”', 'What everyone wants to avoid is a repeat of the mass immunization program following the swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix in 1976. After 45 million doses were distributed, the vaccine was found to be associated with increased cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause paralysis and sometimes death. Even worse, there wasn’t actually a pandemic—the program had been launched in fears that the swine flu virus circulating among recruits at Fort Dix would cause a catastrophic outbreak. In the end, there was no transmission across the U.S., and the vaccination program was canceled.', 'So there will need to be some sort of mechanism to track and monitor for rare safety events even after the vaccine goes on the market. There is already a program to do so, which is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, run by the CDC.', 'While it may be impossible for a phase 3 trial to catch a very rare potential side effect, Offit, of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, points out that “it’s not a risk-free choice to not get the vaccine, if the virus is still circulating.”', 'He added, “If the data were clear that in 20,000 people it appears to be safe and highly efficacious, then you should get the vaccine, because if you’re choosing not to get a vaccine, you’re choosing to risk getting a natural infection, which could be fatal.”', 'The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed has said it “aims to have substantial quantities of a safe and effective vaccine available for Americans by January 2021.”', 'Experts I’ve spoken to have ranged in their optimism about that timeline. The NIH’s Mascola said, “If a study is started in the summertime, it’s possible that by the end of the year we’ll have an answer.”', 'Luciana Borio, M.D., former FDA acting chief scientist and current vice president at In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit strategic investment firm, concurred. “Depending on the results of the clinical trials, I think we might see some vaccine become available before the end of the year, but most people will have to wait for 2021.”', 'Others were more cautious. Orenstein said he thinks there is a “real possibility” that we will have a vaccine by summer next year, “if everything goes well.”', 'Vanderbilt’s Schaffner said he prefers to avoid timelines altogether. “We’re making the same mistake we made back in 2009 when we developed the H1N1 vaccine. We made the same statements and then it took more time than people anticipated, and when it finally came out, the media all said, ‘It’s a late vaccine!’', '“So we overpromised and underdelivered in 2009, and we haven’t learned that lesson. We are overpromising now, and I wish we wouldn’t do that. I wish we would just say, ‘We’re working as hard as we can and we’ll get it to you whenever it’s finished, but we’ve got to do it right.’ And that would be a much more solid message.”', 'Many of the experts I talked to stressed that they wanted to see the phase 3 trials run to completion, however long they took.', 'Brit Trogen, M.D., a pediatrics resident at NYU Langone, said she worries about political pressures on developers. “I consider vaccines to be one of the greatest public health achievements of the past few centuries, and I know the consequences of undervaccinating, because I treat kids who are seriously ill with preventable illness,” she said. “But I worry that at the first hint of something positive, politicians will swoop in and push for an early release beyond what the science allows.”', 'Some also noted that vaccine hesitancy has been growing in the U.S., thanks to a fervent anti-vaccination movement.', 'Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D., a vaccine scientist, professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said communication that focuses solely on speed “is very tone deaf to the fact that there’s an aggressive anti-vax lobby that says that vaccines are rushed and aren’t adequately tested for safety.”', 'I brought these concerns to the FDA, as the agency will ultimately be the one to make the call on when there is sufficient data to approve a vaccine.', '“We recognize that there are some that are concerned that ‘rapid development’ means that vaccine development steps are being skipped, but the FDA scientists will not cut corners in order to approve a vaccine,” the agency responded. “The FDA will thoroughly evaluate the data submitted in support of a vaccine’s safety and effectiveness, and will approve a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 only if the FDA determines that it is safe and effective for its intended use.”', 'When I pause to really think about it, I am staggered by what an enormous undertaking is underway around the globe—and what lies ahead—to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine to billions of people. There is so much at stake, both to give the world a vaccine as soon as possible, and also to not make any critical mistakes in the process. As I cheer on all of the developers, I hope that every country’s leaders will let science and evidence guide decisions every step of the way.', 'I asked Zaks, of Moderna, what kind of pressure he felt, and he answered me in two ways. He said: “Every day and every minute counts.” And then he told me this—that normally, when he works on vaccines, he never gets to meet the people that he’s making the vaccine for. But this pandemic has been different. His future daughter-in-law is a second-year internal medicine resident in New York City, where the coronavirus has hit hard. “This one’s personal,” he said. “This one cuts close to home.”', 'He’s making this vaccine for her.', 'Chris Hendel contributed reporting.']\",\n",

And the British institution will partner with BioNTech in the manufacturing of such vaccines to assess their potential.', 'Imperial will first develop the platform, called RapidVac, to produce vaccines against H1N1, rabies, and Marburg as proof of concept for the project, a CEPI spokesman told FiercePharma. Once the platform is validated, CEPI hopes it can be used to develop vaccines rapidly against new and unknown pathogens, known as “Disease X.”', '“We cannot predict where or when Disease X will strike, but by developing these kinds of innovative vaccine technologies we can be ready for it,” CEPI CEO Richard Hatchett said in a statement.', 'Given CEPI’s focus on vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, the organization will only retain rights to the Marburg candidate and other vaccine candidates against WHO R&D Blueprint priority pathogens that are built using the platform, the CEPI spokesman said in an emailed response.', 'Unlike traditional vaccines that inject the whole antigen in the body to induce an immune response, RNA vaccines incorporate synthetic molecules encoding the antigen genes, which instruct the body to make antigenic protein itself.', 'RELATED: Pfizer pays BioNTech $120M upfront to form mRNA flu vaccine pact', 'Because the RNA approach forgoes the cumbersome and time-consuming virus purification, inactivation and culture process of manufacturing traditional vaccines, and DNA sequencing has made much advancement, RNA-based vaccines can be produced much faster—a key advantage in the face of emerging epidemics. In fact, if successful, CEPI hopes Imperial’s RapidVac can produce clinical trial-ready vaccines against Disease X within 16 weeks of identification of an antigen.', 'Sound familiar? Companies such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-funded CureVac and high-profile Moderna—which is in the process of the largest-ever biotech IPO—are developing vaccines based on similar vaccine platforms. However, in a potential advantage over other mRNA platforms, Imperial’s saRNA platform also keeps the part of the RNA that allows it to multiply.', 'Though there’s no conclusion as to which platform is optimal, in a recent study published in the journal Molecular Therapy, an Imperial-BioNTech team argues that compared with synthetic mRNA vaccines, the saRNA technology requires a much lower dose of the vaccine to achieve the same level of protection, potentially saving more time in production. In mice challenged with H1N1 infection, 80 μg mRNA vaccine was needed to offer full survival, while only 0.05 μg saRNA was needed to achieve that, the team reported.', '“We believe that synthetic self-amplifying RNA based vaccines offer the best opportunity for a ‘just in time’ response to infectious outbreaks, providing the needed technological shift to aggressively redefine the timelines for vaccine production,” Imperial’s saRNA project leader, Prof. Robin Shattock, said in a statement.', 'RELATED: Outbreak alliance hands Johnson & Johnson, Oxford $18.7M for MERS work and more', 'The $8.4 million marks the first investment CEPI has made in vaccine platform technologies that enable rapid vaccine development.

       " '[WASHINGTON] The rising use of cryptocurrencies could undermine effectiveness of US economic and financial sanctions and potentially dent the role of the American dollar, the Treasury Department said on Monday. Following a review on the US sanctions system, Treasury found that \"while sanctions remain an essential and effective policy tool, they also face new challenges including rising risks from new payments systems, the growing use of digital assets, and cybercriminals.\" Treasury sanctions work by blocking targets - individuals, government officials or companies - from using the US financial system, which in effect cuts them off from banking or profiting from trade in most of the world. But digital currencies and alternative payment platforms \"offer malign actors opportunities to hold and transfer funds outside the traditional dollar-based financial system,\" the report said. That in turn offers incentives to find \"new ways of hiding cross-border transactions\" and \"build new financial and payments systems intended to diminish the dollar\\'s global role.\" \"We are mindful of the risk that, if left unchecked, these digital assets and payments systems could harm the efficacy of our sanctions,\" the report said. The report showed use of sanctions increased tenfold over the past two decades, with 9,421 designations this year compared to just 912 in 2000. Treasury said sanctions should have a clear policy objective, be targeted to avoid unintended economic or humanitarian harm, and wherever possible be imposed in coordination with US allies. \"Sanctions are a fundamentally important tool to advance our national security interests,\" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said. But, he added, amid the challenges \"We\\'re committed to working with partners and allies to modernise and strengthen this critical tool.\" Adeyemo is due to testify Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee on the issue.

       " 'London BITCOIN-to-the-moon traders are back with a vengeance as the cryptocurrency approaches its all-time high and demand jumps for bullish contracts across crypto exchanges. The world\\'s largest digital token has surged some 8 per cent over Friday and Saturday to about US$62,100 - taking October\\'s rally to over 40 per cent - after Bloomberg News reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission looks poised to allow the country\\'s first futures-based cryptocurrency ETF. As institutional and retail demand grows for the more than US$1 trillion asset, speculators are eyeing a return to April\\'s US$64,869 record peak while premiums are rising for derivatives betting on higher prices. \"The US was always the big prize and signals further regulatory validation and acceptance of cryptocurrencies,\" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo. \"Momentum is clearly with Bitcoin right now and it\\'s only a matter of time before the April high is taken out.\" All month long, speculation of imminent ETF approval has driven up Bitcoin, helping it outperform smaller tokens to reclaim 46 per cent of the crypto ecosystem\\'s total market value. An exchange-traded fund is expected to draw more interest from investors that prefer buying a familiar, regulated product over navigating digital currency exchanges. In a sign of rising animal spirits, the seven-day average funding rate on Bitcoin futures - the cost of keeping a bullish bet open - rose to 5 per cent on the Binance platform. That compares with just 1.9 per cent at the end of September in Bybt data compiled by The Block, a crypto information service. The value of outstanding futures on crypto exchanges rebounded to US$21.5 billion, compared with the US$27 billion peak earlier this year, according to Bybt. Similarly, the curve has steepened in CME futures, indicating an increasingly optimistic outlook for Bitcoin\\'s trajectory. The gap between December contracts and this month\\'s widened to 990 basis points, the most since April. Ki Young Ju, chief executive officer at analytics firm CryptoQuant, said on Twitter prices have been driven by whales buying large amounts of the cryptocurrency through derivatives. It all marks a shift from recent months, when Bitcoin bulls were left subdued after the May crash and attention turned to a host of other speculative manias like non-fungible tokens. \"With a well integrated ETF structure, crypto is poised to go mainstream,\" said Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swiss-quote Bank. BLOOMBERG',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'OPTIMISM is sky-high in the US$6.7 trillion exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry that after nearly a decade, the first US Bitcoin fund could begin trading next week. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is poised to allow the first US Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund to begin trading in a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry, according to people familiar with the matter. The regulator isn\\'t likely to block the products from starting to trade next week, said the people, who asked not to be named while discussing the decision. Unlike Bitcoin ETF applications that the regulator has previously rejected, the proposals by ProShares and Invesco are based on futures contracts and were filed under mutual fund rules that SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said provide \"significant investor protections\". A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment, as did an official at ProShares. In the past week, crypto lender BlockFi and Cathie Wood\\'s Ark Investment Management have put their names on applications for futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs, a structure that SEC\\'s Gensler has hinted that he\\'d be open to. Meanwhile, Valkyrie Investments updated its futures-backed ETF prospectus with the ticker BTF on Wednesday - typically a sign that an issuer is nearing launch, according to Bloomberg Intelligence\\'s Eric Balchunas. The drama centres on Proshares, given that the SEC\\'s deadline to reject or approve the issuer\\'s futures-based filing under the Investment Company Act of 1940 - a route that offers higher investor protection - expires on Monday. While the ETF industry has watched the SEC demur on countless applications since the Gemini Trust\\'s Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed the first in 2013, Gensler\\'s own words suggest this time is different, Balchunas said. The SEC head signalled that he\\'d favour funds based on CME-traded Bitcoin futures in August - a stance that he reiterated late last month. \"At the end of the day, really the strongest piece of evidence is Gensler\\'s own words. He literally told them what to do,\" Balchunas said. \"They can feel what\\'s going on.\" Should US regulators give the greenlight, four futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs could begin trading on US exchanges this month, with deadlines for applications from Invesco, VanEck and Valkyrie approaching. Meanwhile, dozens of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products have launched in Canada and across Europe. Building speculation around a potential US launch has fuelled a torrent rebound in Bitcoin, with the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency breaking above US$58,000 this week for the first time since May. Bitcoin has surged by over 90 per cent since breaking below US$30,000 in late July. Of course, it\\'s far from certain that the current round of speculation is anything more than wishful thinking. There\\'s roughly a 25 per cent chance that the SEC rejects or delays a decision next week, Balchunas said. And while issuers are clearly hopeful, there\\'s no way to know what regulators are thinking, according to Morningstar. \"Issuers are desperately trying to do everything that they can to be the first, or among the first, out of the gate. This is a good old-fashioned asset grab,\" said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. \"The only thing I think we can say for sure is that they\\'re an indication of where these issuers think the SEC might be leaning.\" Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley chief executive officer James Gorman is staying respectful of cryptocurrencies. \"I don\\'t think crypto is a fad. I don\\'t think it\\'s going to go away,\" he said on the bank\\'s third-quarter earnings call with analysts on Thursday morning. \"I don\\'t know what the value of Bitcoin should or shouldn\\'t be. But these things aren\\'t going away, and the blockchain technology supporting it is obviously very real and powerful.\" That sets him up as a foil to rival Jamie Dimon, who runs JPMorgan Chase & Co. \"I personally think that Bitcoin is worthless,\" Dimon said this week at the Institute of International Finance annual membership meeting. He added that clients are \"adults\" and that the firm can give them \"clean as possible access\". Citigroup boss Jane Fraser struck a similar note this week: \"We\\'re fairly cautious around crypto as a bank. We proceed with great caution on that one as to where the value is and isn\\'t,\" she said. \"I am frankly much more excited about the technologies behind crypto than some of the products themselves.\" In September, Morgan Stanley said Sheena Shah will lead a new team researching cryptocurrencies. On the earnings call, Gorman added that the firm isn\\'t directly trading crypto for retail clients, instead giving them access to buy crypto through various funds. \"For us, honestly, it\\'s just not a huge part of the business demand from our clients. And that may evolve and we\\'ll evolve with it,\" he said. \"We\\'re watchful of it, we\\'re respectful, and we\\'ll wait and see how the regulators handle it.\" BLOOMBERG',\n",

       " '[LONDON] The United States has overtaken China as the biggest miner of bitcoin following Beijing\\'s crackdown on the method used to unearth the world\\'s major cryptocurrency, a study showed on Wednesday. Figures released by the University of Cambridge showed that activity in the US more than doubled in the four months to the end of August, increasing the market share held by the world\\'s biggest economy to 35.4 per cent. Kazakhstan, in second place, also more than doubled its activity to 18.1 per cent, followed by Russia with 11 per cent, said Michel Rauchs at the university\\'s centre for alternative finance. China banned the mining of bitcoin in June, as authorities have said for a long time that there were strong links between the cryptocurrency and money laundering. Mining for bitcoin requires powerful computers to solve complex puzzles, resulting in the consumption of huge amounts of electricity. According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, mining of the cryptocurrency uses an amount of electricity equivalent to 0.45 per cent of global output, or the same amount produced by the Philippines. Rauchs said that with China\\'s ban, global mining of bitcoin immediately slumped by more than one third, but has since rebounded. \"That initial 38 per cent drop... in June was partially offset by a 20 per cent bounceback over July and August, suggesting that some Chinese mining equipment has been successfully redeployed overseas,\" the expert said. \"Further, as of early October, the trajectory is indicating that all, or nearly all, of that June downturn would be fully recovered soon,\" Rauchs added.

       " '[NEW YORK] A rally in Bitcoin paused around the US$57,000 level Tuesday amid ongoing speculation that the largest cryptocurrency could retest the record highs reached earlier this year. The digital currency fell about 1 per cent to US$56,700 as of 11.05 am in Hong Kong, while the wider Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index edged lower. Bitcoin is up 90 per cent from a July low and in sight of its mid-April record of almost US$65,000. As in past rallies, many reasons have been cited for the latest surge. They include easing concerns about regulatory efforts in the US and China and signs of a rebound in the computing power devoted to mining Bitcoin. Optimism is also growing about possible US Securities and Exchange Commission approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. \"Bitcoin will likely need a fresh catalyst to make US$60,000 happen, but if that happens quickly, record highs might not be hard to reach,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a note. Bitcoin\\'s relative strength index is about 70, suggesting it\\'s flirting with overbought territory. At the same time, the digital coin is prone to volatile swings that can trample over the best efforts to gauge its outlook.

The \"negative list\" details sectors and industries that are off-limits to both Chinese and foreign investors. Regulators in China banned cryptocurrency trading and mining this year, with the country\\'s central bank vowing to purge \"illegal\" cryptocurrency activities last month. The crackdown has prompted cryptocurrency exchanges to cut ties with Chinese users. China also has been tightening control over public discourse, cracking down on show business for \"polluting\" society and asking mobile browsers to eliminate the spreading of rumours, the use of sensationalist headlines and the publishing of content that violates the core values of socialism. The state planner said it was halting the investment of \"non-public\" capital into a variety of publishing activities, including live broadcasts, news-gathering, editing and broadcasting entities and the operation of news. Non-public capital cannot be involved in the introduction of news released by overseas entities or summits and award selection activities in the field of news and public opinion, the NDRC added.

The world\\'s largest digital asset, overcoming a slew of potentially negative factors that had dogged it earlier this year, is up about 10 per cent over the past five sessions. That gain puts it on track for its best week since the start of August and pads its year-to-date advance to 87 per cent. It rose about 0.6 per cent to US$54,526 as of 2.26 pm in New York. \"It actually is pretty amazing how well it\\'s done,\" JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. \"Just a few weeks ago we had what looked like really bad news out of China that had the possibility to upset the apple cart - and for a couple of days it kind of did. But it\\'s quickly recovered and continued this incredible rally.\" Meanwhile, Shiba Inu, a cryptocurrency started just last year, did retreat a bit after soaring in the wake of an Elon Musk tweet about his puppy. Silvergate Capital, which operates the crypto friendly Silvergate Bank, continued to surge, pushing its two-week gain to more than 50 per cent. A handful of factors have lined up in Bitcoin\\'s favour of late. For one, China\\'s latest crackdown on cryptocurrency transactions, which had caused a rout last month, has been overshadowed by more bullish news: A Bank of America report calling the asset class too big for investors to ignore and optimism over US Bancorp\\'s launch of custody services to institutional investors. Others are pointing to rising inflation - Bitcoin, they say, could act as a good hedge amid spiking prices in everything from energy to cotton to food. \"In the backdrop of rising crude prices, rising energy prices, increasing concerns about inflation not being \\'transitory\\', I would think that would have to be a major driver,\" said Ben McMillan, CIO at IDX, a quantitative index fund manager. \"That\\'s obviously fuelling a lot of sentiment for Bitcoin as a store of value, as a hedge against inflation.\" JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts, in a report this week, said there are now tentative signs that the shift away from gold and into Bitcoin - something also seen during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 - has started re-emerging in recent weeks. \"Institutional investors appear to be returning to Bitcoin perhaps seeing it as a better inflation hedge than gold,\" strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note. The coin\\'s market share has increased, which the strategists see as a healthy development \"as it is more likely to reflect institutional participation than smaller cryptocurrencies\". There\\'s been a lot of recent economic data pointing to inflation, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. \"Bitcoin has really taken the place of gold in a lot of people\\'s hearts and minds and portfolios, and so I think what you\\'re seeing with Bitcoin is what you typically would see with gold and that\\'s the asset that is best positioned to hedge you against inflation will typically do better when the general public believes inflation is more of a concern rather than less of a concern.\" Meanwhile, investors are becoming more optimistic that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve one or more Bitcoin ETFs this month. The regulator has a number of applications to consider - this time around, many follow a format that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has indicated could be received favourably by the regulator. \"The market is starting to price in a higher expectation of a futures ETF coming,\" said David Grider, head of research at Grayscale. Aggregate open interest in Bitcoin options and futures across major exchanges has also risen, up 21 per cent over the past seven days, according to data from ViewBase, a digital-asset analytics company. Coupled with rising prices, it could indicate investors are loading up on leverage and betting prices could rise further, according to ViewBase. \"There\\'s creative destruction happening in the area,\" said Steve Kolano, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Investor Solutions, whose team manages around US$30 billion. \"We believe that digital currency is a trend that\\'s probably here to stay.\" Kolano cited the wave of major central banks that have been looking into digital currencies. \"That\\'s a trend,\" he said. \"That digitisation is a trend that probably continues and, in a lot of ways, changes the nature of fiat versus digital currency and the way financial transactions happen.\" BLOOMBERG',\n",

It continued to fall in September, hitting a low of US$40,596 on Sept 21. On Tuesday, Bitcoin rose as much as 2.35 per cent to hit US$50,398.10; cryptocurrency investment products and funds recorded inflows for a seventh straight week, as institutional investors warmed to more supportive statements from regulators, data from digital asset manager CoinShares showed on Monday. Bank of America Corp strategists, throwing their weight behind crypto as a new asset class, declared it to be too big a class to ignore. Alkesh Shah and Jessica Reif Ehrlich, for example, said: \"Our view is that there could be more opportunity than sceptics expect.\" The Bank of America report shows that enthusiasm for crypto is gaining traction on Wall Street, despite its many controversies. Just last month, China issued a blanket ban on transactions and US financial watchdogs are investigating some of the biggest crypto exchanges. In the eyes of Bank of America, however, more regulation could be a positive for crypto in the long run. Once rules are established, the uncertainty over how to invest in crypto will be lifted, the strategists wrote. With its latest rally, Bitcoin has broken through two key resistance levels and is now trading at the higher end of its two-month-long consolidation range, according to a report from Arcane Research. The coin hovered around US$45,000 for a while before finally breaking out. That means the US$46,000-US$48,000 range is a strong support level and the coin could trade in that area for some time, the report said. REUTERS, BLOOMBERG',\n",
       " 'Oakland, California A CRYPTOCURRENCY broker that the Biden administration considers a key cog in the recent ransomware epidemic is legally registered in the Czech Republic but doesn\\'t appear to have an office there. It may be operating out of Moscow\\'s tallest skyscraper despite its not being listed at the address. It earned the distinction last month of being the first crypto exchange to be blacklisted by the US as governments try to stem further attacks. And while it denies any part in the recent spate of cyber crimes, experts say it\\'s a prime example of a shadowy corner of the industry that has allowed hackers to thrive by giving them the means to launder millions of dollars in illicit digital proceeds through \"nested\" middlemen that tap larger exchanges to process transactions. Suex OTC, a virtual currency exchange, is a transactions platform that allows cryptocurrency traders to buy and sell digital coins. It is accused by the US of mixing legitimate digital currency trades with illegal transfers from ransomware gangs, allowing them to launder profits from the kind of attacks that have crippled hospitals, businesses, school districts and even a major US fuel pipeline. The US Treasury Department alleges that Suex has played an integral role in helping criminal hackers clean and cash out their loot, mostly Bitcoin paid by ransomware victims, before converting it to a traditional currency. \"There is an illicit underbelly that\\'s formed in this ecosystem,\" said Todd Conklin, counsellor to the deputy secretary of the Treasury. \"We haven\\'t yet cleansed the entire ecosystem and we\\'re definitely continuing to investigate other nested exchanges and mixers, like Suex.\" Since at least 2018, Suex has converted cryptocurrency holdings into cash inside brick-and-mortar offices in Moscow, St Petersburg and possibly in the Middle East, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain forensics firm specialising in following the movement of digital currencies whose clients have included US federal agencies. Suex is legally registered in the Czech Republic but apparently doesn\\'t have an office there, according to Chainalysis. At the official address in a nondescript house in Prague\\'s Old Town, there\\'s a clothing store and antiques shops on the ground floor, and several residential units and a law firm. The law firm at the address where Suex is registered specialises in incorporation and corporate governance services. A person at the firm who answered a call from Bloomberg denied having any knowledge of Suex and hung up the phone. The company does appear to be operating from Moscow\\'s 97-story-high Federation Tower East building, according to Chainalysis. There\\'s no public directory of tenants at the entrance, and the receptionist bans entry to anyone who hasn\\'t been invited. While, per the building\\'s management, Suex\\'s name isn\\'t listed at the address, a company called Art of Web - which counts Egor Petukhovsky, Suex\\'s chief executive officer and largest shareholder - is. Suex\\'s Mr Petukhovsky didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. He denied in a recent Facebook post that he or his business helped launder money for hackers and vowed to \"firmly defend my name in litigation\" in the US. \"I believe in independent justice and hope to come back to normal life as soon as possible,\" he said. Other Suex officials couldn\\'t be located for comment. By adding Suex to the Treasury Department\\'s list of sanctioned entities, US based companies and individuals are prohibited from conducting any transactions with them. While these sanctions will likely do little to expose Suex to legal authorities half a world away, the Biden administration is hoping it may dissuade US-based ransomware victims from quickly paying ransom to resolve their ordeal. Brokers like Suex don\\'t typically build their own software systems to execute cryptocurrency trades. Instead, these operators trade on third-party crypto exchanges. The Treasury Department declined to identify which exchanges it believes Suex had utilised except to say \"several\". Regulators globally have called for tighter enforcement and regulations requiring exchanges to collect data to identify their clients. Suex has so far received at least US$160 million in Bitcoin from illicit and high-risk sources since 2018, according to Chainalysis. If this is correct, that\\'s about 40 per cent of Suex\\'s known transaction history linked to the activity of hackers, including nearly US$13 million from some of the more infamous ransomware groups - Ryuk and Conti - according to Chainalysis. Despite Suex\\'s denial, the Treasury Department\\'s crackdown should, at least temporarily, narrow the illicit pipeline of digital currency transfers, according to Tom Robinson, co-founder of blockchain forensics firm Elliptic. \"It means one less place for ransomware gangs to cash out their earnings, although there are still plenty of other ways they can still do that,\" he said.

       " 'SOUTH-EAST Asia\\'s largest bank DBS has gotten approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to provide digital payment token (DPT) services. This was one of two such licences granted on Friday - the other to Australian crypto exchange Independent Reserve. The licence awarded to DBS\\'s brokerage arm DBS Vickers allows it to directly support asset managers and companies to trade in digital payment tokens through the DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx). The members-only bourse was launched last December - a move welcomed by many players hoping that a reputable bank\\'s entrance into the digital assets space will bring credibility and more adoption. \"Having received formal regulatory approval from MAS, DBS Vickers is now in a better position to support institutional and corporate investors in tapping into the growing potential of digital assets as an investment class,\" said Eng-Kwok Seat Moey, the exchange\\'s chair and head of capital markets at DBS, in a statement on Friday. \"We believe that DBSV\\'s licence, coupled with recent enhancements to DDEx such as round the-clock operations since August, could add to DDEx\\'s volumes in the coming months and accelerate growth momentum for DBS\\'s digital asset ecosystem.\"']"

      "APOLLO Global Management has begun holding cryptocurrency on behalf of its clients through a partnership with digital asset platform Anchorage Digital, in a major push by one of the world's largest asset managers to bring crypto to institutional investors.\n",
      "The move comes despite a rocky year for the crypto market, with bitcoin, the world's largest digital asset, down more than 50 per cent since the start of 2022, as investors have appeared jittery about decades-high inflation across the globe.\n",
      "\"It's the validation of this incessant drumbeat that is here to stay,\" said Diogo Mónica, president of Anchorage Digital, a crypto firm that holds a national trust bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. \"This is a very long-term horizon process and technology and that for the large institutions, it doesn't really matter that there is volatility short term.\"\n",
      "Apollo, which declined to disclose what types of crypto assets it holds, said its relationship with Anchorage dates back to the middle of last year, when the firm first began exploring how best to safeguard its clients' crypto assets. Apollo later participated in Anchorage's Series D funding round, which was finalised in December 2021.\n",
      "\"As we explore creative ways to apply blockchain technology across Apollo's business, we look forward to collabourating with Anchorage for the safekeeping of client assets,\" said Adam Eling, chief operating officer of Apollo's digital assets team.\n",
      "Mónica said Anchorage is also engaged with discussions about how to potentially further expand its relationship with Apollo in the future.\n",
      "Your feedback is important to us\n",
      "Tell us what you think. Email us at btuserfeedback@sph.com.sg\n",
      "In April, Apollo hired former JPMorgan Chase executive Christine Moy, who will lead digital asset strategy across the business, and play a key role in its investment decisions in crypto, blockchain and Web3, a decentralised version of the Internet. REUTERS\n",
