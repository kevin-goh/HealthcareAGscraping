And, at this year’s American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting, Legend and J&J rolled out such positive survival data from their cilta-cel trial that some analysts suggested—if it’s approved in February as expected—it could have an edge on Bristol Myers Squibb’s rival CAR-T Abecma.',\n",

At ASH, both companies rolled out impressive data from their trials in the second-line setting, but Gilead could have the upper hand by virtue of its three-year head start in the market, analysts said. Gilead expects to hear from the FDA on a label expansion in the second-line setting in April.',\n",

Novartis left the gate with Zolgensma priced at $2.1 million.
