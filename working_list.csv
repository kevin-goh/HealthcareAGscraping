The agency previously reviewed and accepted the trial design.', 'The trial was designed to “account for the complex global nature of dengue,” Dubin said in a statement.', '“The study was designed per World Health Organization (WHO) guidance for a second-generation dengue vaccine, and it considered the need to achieve high levels of subject retention and protocol compliance in endemic regions,” Takeda pointed out.', 'In a long-term exploratory analysis of the TIDES trial, Qdenga prevented 84% of hospitalizations and 61% of symptomatic dengue illness after four and a half years.

13,"['GSK experienced an eventful 2022. The British drugmaker officially spun out its consumer health joint venture with Pfizer. And the company’s flagship vaccines business appears to be on the mend. But its burgeoning oncology portfolio suffered multiple setbacks.  ', 'On the sidelines of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Fierce Pharma sat down with GSK’s chief commercial officer Luke Miels, who recently took on additional responsibilities in vaccine strategies.  ', ""A wide range of topics were discussed, including GSK’s preparation for upcoming FDA decisions for its RSV vaccine, potential first-in-class chronic kidney disease (CKD) anemia drug daprodustat and newly acquired JAK inhibitor momelotinib, as well as the company’s decisions to either withdraw or limit the use of cancer drugs Blenrep and Zejula. And an upcoming phase 3 readout for a combination of Zejula and GSK's PD-1 inhibitor Jemperli has, as Miels put it, a low chance of success. GSK’s mRNA vaccine collaboration with CureVac and the company’s appetite for additional M&A deals were also included."", ' ', 'Background: After an initial setback with their mRNA COVID vaccine, GSK and partner CureVac came back a few days ago with positive preliminary data for their modified COVID and flu shots. But the question is, with entrenched mRNA players Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, is there any room left for another COVID shot?', ""Miels: “For COVID? Limited. But I think the real interest is in the COVID-flu combination, where I think there is a sizable market opportunity.” Under the deal structure, GSK would capture 90% of the asset’s value. If the mRNA COVID-flu vaccines are successful, the whole COVID market and “a large part” of the flu shot market will covert to the combo because “people prefer one shot instead of two.” To convince people to convert, the COVID component of the combo needs to be “as good as or better than current options.” As for the flu element, the mRNA technology allows for longer time to study the flu season to better choose the dominant strain for the vaccine construct. It also allows for more strains to be included than the current quadrivalent options. MRNA vaccines' tolerability profile could be a challenge in the flu setting, but there's “heavy overlap” between COVID and flu shots takers."", ' ', ""Background: GSK's application for an RSV vaccine for adults 60 years and older is under FDA priority review, with a decision expected by May 3. Pfizer has a candidate targeting the same population also under priority review for a verdict in May. Furthermore, Pfizer touted positive data for its maternal vaccine to protect newborns, but GSK's maternal effort hit a safety hiccup."", ""Miels: GSK will initially focus on high-risk individuals for the RSV launch. There are “a lot of parallels” between RSV and shingles in that vaccine makers need to create an “explained demand” because no RSV preventive solutions were available. But awareness is increasing, and COVID taught people with underlying diseases that they are also at a higher risk of developing serious complications from respiratory diseases, and they could therefore be motivated to get an RSV shot. GSK hopes RSV vaccines could match the penetration levels seen with flu shots. Between the two populations, older adults currently represent a bigger market than newborns. (During the Q&A session after GSK's presentation at JPM, Miels said doctors see “distinct difference” between Pfizer's and GSK's candidates in high-risk patients. The “biggest variable” in its competition with Pfizer right now, Miels said, is whether a vaccine could offer protection longer than one year, and GSK expects to have data on that before its final payer discussions in June.)"", ' ', ""Background: GSK's oncology ambition took a serious hit late 2022 when Blenrep failed as a monotherapy in a confirmatory phase 3 trial. GSK immediately pulled the BCMA-targeted agent's accelerated approval at FDA’s request but put up a bold front for its two phase 3 trials testing a lower Blenrep dose in combinations. Readouts are expected in the first half. Also in blood cancer, GSK’s application for JAK inhibitor momelotinib in myelofibrosis is awaiting an FDA decision by June 16. GSK got momelotinib from its $1.9 billion acquisition of Sierra Oncology last year and, at the time, touted the med's fit with Blenrep in hematology."", 'Miels: GSK has kept the commercial team behind Blenrep in place for a potential momelotinib approval. About 75% of multiple myeloma doctors also treat myelofibrosis. With Blenrep, the problem is about finding the right dose. The FDA has told GSK the original monotherapy dosage is too high. The soon-to-report DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 combo trials could find the optimal dose for Blenrep, and GSK looks to reintroduce the drug if trials are positive.', ' ', ""Background: The FDA recently took issue with concerning patient survival data coming from PARP inhibitors in some ovarian cancer settings. As part of the classwide scrutiny, GSK pulled a Zejula late-line indication and narrowed its second-line maintenance use to just ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations. Despite a broad label in all ovarian cancer patients who've responded to initial chemotherapy treatment, Zejula has mostly only been able to reach patients without homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), while AstraZeneca and Merck's Lynparza continues to hold the lion's share of the HRD-positive market—more specifically, the BRCA-mutant subgroup—in the first-line maintenance setting."", ""Miels: The label reduction affects 20% of Zejula's sales. But it also allows GSK to have another discussion with physicians to try to convince them to use Zejula early in the first-line setting to reap the maximum benefit for patients. The “bulk of physicians” don't extrapolate results in the later-line trials to newly diagnosed patients, and they recognize patient crossovers are a big problem that could muddy the results to the Zejula arm's detriment. Zejula currently captures 50% of new patient starts in first-line maintenance treatment. In doctors' minds, the GSK drug is perceived more as a therapy for nonmutant cases. Lynparza's overall survival data, longer time on the market and broader indications in multiple tumor types make doctors' positive opinions toward Lynparza “difficult to dislodge,” and the current market dynamics will likely stay “static.” GSK also expects a 2023 readout from an adaptive phase 3 trial called FIRST that tests Zejula in combination with GSK's PD-1 inhibitor Jemperli. The study has a very low chance of being successful because ovarian cancer isn't immunogenic. But if that study turns out positive, “that could change people's mind” of Zejula."", ' ', ""Background: GSK recently showed that Jemperli could match up to Keytruda in their respective combinations with chemo in newly diagnosed nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in the phase 2 PERLA trial. Data on tumor shrinkage and delaying tumor progression actually favored Jemperli, though the trial wasn't powered to show statistically significant superiority. Separately, in a small academic-sponsored trial readout that somehow captured the attention of the likes of The New York Times, Jemperli eradicated tumors in all 14 patients with mismatch repair-deficient locally advanced rectal cancer. The results, while not actionable from a regulatory standpoint, could potentially boost Jemperli's competitive edge as a latecomer in the crowded PD-1/L1 space."", ""Miels: “We're not expecting to replace [Keytruda] in the first line. But we did [the PERLA trial], because we wanted to validate in physicians' minds and the FDA's mind that these are comparable.” Those data could help change Jemperli's prescriber base, and PERLA offers GSK a clinical and regulatory pathway to get further approvals for Jemperli in combinations with TIGIT and CD96 inhibitors. Currently, most Jemperli use is in second-line endometrial cancer, but GSK expects a phase 3 readout in first-line endometrial cancer in the first quarter."", ' ', 'Background: The novel HIF-PHI class of oral drugs for anemia in CKD once bore high hopes to displace erythropoietin stimulating agents. But safety signals have derailed two agents, and now it’s up to GSK’s daprodustat. The FDA once again raised cardiovascular safety concerns around daprodustat. During an advisory committee meeting, FDA’s external experts voted in favor of the GSK drug in dialysis-dependent anemic CKD patients but recommended against it in nondialysis population.', 'Miels: If dapro is approved only in dialysis patients, GSK doesn’t plan to run any additional trials to try to resurrect the nondialysis indication. In that scenario, GSK’s commercialization strategy will focus on contracting with dialysis providers. If, in the low chance that dapro also receives an approval in the nondialysis population, it will be a “classical cardiometabolic product launch,” including field force detailing.', ' ', 'Background: GSK narrowed its focus on innovative medicines and vaccines with the spinoff of consumer health venture Haleon. The new GSK’s M&A moves have therefore become a focus among investors. Apart from striking licensing deals like that with CureVac, GSK bought Sierra Oncology for $1.9 billion and took in pneumococcal vaccine developer Affinivax in a deal worth up to $3.3 billion.', 'Miels: GSK will continue to look for acquisitions in that ballpark. Sierra is a great “template deal” for GSK; i.e., in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. “My preference is to do a whole series of deals in that range.” The size may be bigger, “but you’re not going to see us going out and doing Horizon-type transactions.” (In the largest biopharma deal of 2022, Amgen will purchase Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion.) GSK is agnostic about therapeutic areas, but the company intends to focus more on late-stage assets.']","Jan 11, 2023 05:45pm"

The lack of human data added another wrinkle to the increasingly stubborn COVID-19 vaccine market.', 'Now, Moderna is rounding out its case with results from testing its updated vaccine in people—and the data also vouches for the shot against an emerging coronavirus mutation, too. In a phase 2/3 trial of more than 500 adults, Moderna’s bivalent booster mRNA 1273.222 triggered a “significantly higher” immune response against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants compared to an auxiliary dose of the company’s standard vaccine, mRNA-1273, which bears the commercial moniker Spikevax.', 'While the data “appear encouraging on first look,” there are several caveats surrounding the effectiveness of both Pfizer and Moderna’s re-tooled shots, according to a note from Bloomberg Intelligence, posted on Twitter.', 'Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sam Fazeli flagged the fact that Moderna’s study “lack[s] disclosure of antibody titers for the control.” Fazeli also highlighted the fact that those given the bivalent booster had had their previous shot 9.5 months before versus 4.5 months for Spikevax. This gave the bivalent patients more time to “naturally develop more effective antibodies against BA.4/5.”', 'The results come shortly after Moderna published data in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a separate, BA.1-targeting bivalent vaccine—mRNA 1273.214—elicited a superior immune response against BA.1, BA.4 and BA.5 versus Spikevax classic, with that greater protection lasting at least three months.', 'Uncertainties aside, Moderna could certainly use the booster win. After a turbulent third quarter of production and safety “pain points,” the company in early November trimmed its annual sales forecast for Spikevax from $21 billion to a range of $18 billion to $19 billion.

After setting a highly ambitious goal of producing 300 million doses in 2020, the effort produced barely 100 million.', 'In his upcoming book, Warp Speed: Inside the Operation that Beat COVID, the Critics, and the Odds, Paul Mango discusses—with some interesting revelations—the manufacturing constraints that the operation faced and why the pledge proved unrealistic. Mango, the former deputy chief of staff at HHS, followed the agency’s chief Alex Azar when he took a major role with Warp Speed.', 'In the summer of 2020, when Warp Speed identified six vaccine candidates to pursue, the team kicked off a massive manufacturing scale-up from 27 facilities that either were starting from scratch or had to be expanded for vaccine production.', 'No expense was spared. For example, when 2,000-liter vats—used in the manufacture of bulk substance for vaccines—were needed in the U.S., a producer in Switzerland said it had extras on hand and could deliver them by ship in six weeks. But General Gus Perna of Warp Speed—by way of the Army Materiel Command—had an alternate solution.', '“I’ll have military aircraft there tomorrow, so get ready to load,” Perna said, as Mango recalled in a recent interview with Fierce Pharma.', 'The immediate lack of equipment and raw materials needed to produce the vaccines early in the pandemic has been well documented. But according to Mango, the biggest impediment to a quick scale-up was the lack of trained labor.', 'Warp Speed’s manufacturing guru Carlo de Notaristefani, formerly the CEO at Teva, was fully aware of the potential problems posed by the human element in a quick scale up and warned of it.', '“In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the typical approach is to perfect each step in the process and then pull it all together and when you do that, it never works like it’s designed to,” Mango said. “Carlo said, ‘99% of the time, it’s some worker, some trained technician who doesn’t follow procedure. That’s why we get ourselves in trouble with contamination.’ And by the way, that happened along the way.”', 'Mango’s reference, of course, was to the high-profile errors made at Emergent’s Baltimore plant, where millions of doses Johnson & Johnson vaccines had to be discarded because of cross contamination. Officials warned Emergent—which was producing both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines—of the potential for mistakes, Mango said.', 'For its part, Emergent maintains that Operation Warp Speed, FDA and other government officials were onsite on multiple occasions and were engaged in production decisions.', '""Despite the risks that were discussed and well-known by all parties, including the federal government, OWS officials directed Emergent to move forward with tech-transferring and scaling up commercial production of two novel coronavirus vaccine candidates in the facility, due to the pressing needs of the pandemic,"" an Emergent spokesman said.', 'In addition, Warp Speed officials concluded that the concept of holding a facility in reserve—as the United States had done for a decade with Emergent—was flawed, Mango said. Their advice for the future was to have an active vaccine plant with excess capacity up and running with a trained workforce that can be flexed to add capacity. The site could be audited, tested and trained annually to ensure its readiness.', '“It’s too expensive to just have an idle plant,” Mango said. ', 'Emergent agrees that the program was not executed as it was designed. ', '""The initial plan for the [Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing] was for readiness for the production of only 50 million doses of flu vaccine over a four-month period, nowhere near the hundreds of millions of vaccine doses required by the pandemic,"" Emergent\'s spokesman said. ""But even under the original concept, the government never delivered the drug development work necessary to build capacity, develop a skilled workforce, and maintain an adequate state of readiness at any of the CIADM facilities.""', 'Another company that didn’t deliver, Mango said, was Pfizer. The company came up short on its pledge to supply the U.S. with 40 million doses, blaming manufacturing delays which Warp Speed said it wasn’t apprised of.', ""Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment. The company has said, while admitting that it didn't meet the pledge, that the promises were more flexible than portrayed by Mango."", ""Along with its vaccine partner BioNTech, Pfizer quickly overcame its early manufacturing delays to become the world's most prolific supplier of COVID-19 vaccines.

', ""Drugmakers like Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson are homing in on another major hurdle: efficiency. Both companies are testing vaccines that could work after one dose, rather than two, which would stretch supplies to cover more patients. J&J’s adenovirus hopeful, still in phase 3, can also last up to three months refrigerated, or up to two years frozen. J&J in late December said it expects interim data in January and an FDA filing in February. Merck and Themis, meanwhile, are developing a one-dose option using the biotech's virus vector-based platform."", 'Plus, Merck has an oral vaccine in its sights.

AstraZeneca, which is running the global trial of the vaccine it produced with the University of Oxford, said the trial volunteer recovered from a severe inflammation of the spinal cord and is no longer hospitalized.', 'AstraZeneca has not confirmed that the patient was afflicted with transverse myelitis, but Nath and another neurologist said they understood this to be the case. Transverse myelitis produces a set of symptoms involving inflammation along the spinal cord that can cause pain, muscle weakness and paralysis. Britain’s regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, reviewed the case and has allowed the trial to resume in the U.K.', 'AstraZeneca “need[s] to be more forthcoming with a potential complication of a vaccine which will eventually be given to millions of people,” said Nath. “We would like to see how we can help, but the lack of information makes it difficult to do so.”', 'Any decision about whether to continue the trial is complex, because it’s difficult to assess the cause of a rare injury that occurs during a vaccine trial—and because scientists and authorities have to weigh the risk of uncommon side effects against a vaccine that might curb the pandemic.', '“So many factors go into these decisions,” Nath said. “I’m sure everything is on the table. The last thing you want to do is hurt healthy people.”', 'The NIH has yet to get tissue or blood samples from the British patient, and its investigation is “in the planning stages,” Nath said. U.S. scientists could look at samples from other vaccinated patients to see whether any of the antibodies they generated in response to the coronavirus also attack brain or spinal cord tissue.', 'Such studies might take a month or two, he said. The FDA declined to comment on how long it would take before it decides whether to move forward.', 'Jesse Goodman, M.D., a Georgetown University professor and physician who was chief scientist and lead vaccine regulator at the FDA during the Obama administration, said the agency will review the data and possibly consult with British regulators before allowing resumption of the U.S. study, which had just begun when the injury was reported. Two other coronavirus vaccines are also in late-stage trials in the U.S.', 'If it determines the injury in the British trial was caused by the vaccine, the FDA could pause the trial. If it allows it to resume, regulators and scientists surely will be on the watch for similar symptoms in other trial participants.', 'A volunteer in an earlier phase of the AstraZeneca trial experienced a similar side effect, but investigators discovered she had multiple sclerosis that was unrelated to the vaccination, according to Elliot Frohman, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology Center at the University of Texas.', 'Neurologists who study illnesses like transverse myelitis say they are rare—occurring at a rate of perhaps 1 in 250,000 people—and strike most often as a result of the body’s immune response to a virus. Less frequently, such episodes have also been linked to vaccines.', 'The precise cause of the disease is key to the decision by authorities whether to resume the trial. Sometimes an underlying medical condition is “unmasked” by a person’s immune response to the vaccine, leading to illness, as happened with the MS patient. In that case, the trial might be continued without fear, because the illness was not specific to the vaccine.', 'More worrisome is a phenomenon called “molecular mimicry.” In such cases, some small piece of the vaccine may be similar to tissue in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in an immune attack on that tissue in response to a vaccine component. Should that be the case, another occurrence of transverse myelitis would be likely if the trial resumed, said William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A second case would shut down the trial, he said.', 'In 1976, a massive swine flu vaccination program was halted when doctors began diagnosing a similar disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), in people who received the vaccine. At the time no one knew how common GBS was, so it was difficult to tell whether the episodes were related to the vaccine.', 'Eventually, scientists found that the vaccine increased the risk of the disorder by an additional one case among every 100,000 vaccinated patients. Typical seasonal flu vaccination raises the risk of GBS in about one additional case in every 1 million people.', '“It’s very, very hard” to determine if one rare event was caused by a vaccine, Schaffner said. “How do you attribute an increased risk for something that occurs in one in a million people?”', 'Before allowing U.S. trials to restart, the FDA will want to see why the company and an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) in the U.K. felt it was safe to continue, Goodman said. The AstraZeneca trial in the U.S. has a separate safety board.', 'FDA officials will need to review full details of the case and may request more information about the affected study volunteer before deciding whether to allow the U.S. trial to continue, Goodman said. They may also require AstraZeneca to update the safety information it provides to study participants.', 'It’s possible that the volunteer’s health problem was a coincidence unrelated to the vaccine, said Amesh Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Studies aren’t usually stopped over a single health problem, even if it’s serious.', 'Yet many health leaders have expressed frustration that AstraZeneca hasn’t released more information about the health problem that led it to halt its U.K. trial.', '“There is just so little information about this that it’s impossible to understand what the diagnosis was or why the DSMB and sponsor were reassured” that it was safe to continue, Goodman said.', 'AstraZeneca has said it’s unable to provide more information about the health problem, saying this would violate patient privacy, although it didn’t say how.', 'But there’s an exceptional need for transparency in a political climate rife with vaccine hesitancy and mistrust of the Trump administration’s handling of the COVID-19 response, leading scientists say.', '“While I respect the critical need for patient confidentiality, I think it would be really helpful to know what their assessment of these issues was,” Goodman said. “What was the diagnosis? If there wasn’t a clear diagnosis, what is it that led them to feel the trial could be restarted? There is so much interest and potential concern about a COVID-19 vaccine that the more information that can be provided, the more reassuring that would be.”', 'The FDA will need to balance any possible risks from an experimental vaccine with the danger posed by COVID-19, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans.', '“There are also potential consequences if you stop a study,” Goodman said.', 'If the AstraZeneca vaccine fails, the U.S. government is supporting six other COVID-19 vaccines in the hope at least one will succeed. The potential problems with the AstraZeneca vaccine show this to be a wise investment, Adalja said.', '“This is part of the idea of not having just one vaccine candidate going forward,” he said. “It gives you a little more insurance.”', 'Schaffner said researchers need to remember that vaccine research is unpredictable.', '“The investigators have inadvisedly been hyping their own vaccine,” Schaffner said. “The Oxford investigators were out there this summer saying, ‘We’re going to get there first.’ But this is exactly the sort of reason … Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and the rest of us have been saying, ‘You never know what will happen once you get into large-scale human trials.’”', 'This KHN story first published on California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.', 'KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

As for when trial results will be available, “we cannot determine if it will be the middle of October or December.”', 'Safety boards set “stopping rules” at the beginning of a study, making their criteria for ending a trial very clear, said Eric Topol, M.D., executive vice president for research at Scripps Research in San Diego and an expert on the use of data in medical research.', 'Although the safety board can recommend stopping a trial, the ultimate decision to halt a study is made by the scientists running the trial, Topol said.', 'A vaccine manufacturer could then apply to the Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization, which can be granted quickly, or continue through the regular drug approval process, which requires more time and evidence.', 'Safety monitors also can stop a trial because of safety concerns, “if it looks like it’s actually harming people in the vaccine arm, due to a lot of adverse events,” Fauci said.', 'Fauci said people can trust the process, because all the data that outside monitors used to make their decisions would be made public.', '“All of that has to be transparent,” Fauci said. “The only time you get concerned is if there is any pressure to terminate the trial before you have enough data on safety and efficacy.”', 'Topol and other scientists have sharply criticized the FDA in recent weeks, accusing Commissioner Stephen Hahn, M.D., of bowing to political pressure from the Trump administration, which has pushed the agency to approve COVID treatments faster.', 'Stopping trials early poses a number of risks, such as making a vaccine look more effective than it really is, Topol said.', '“If you stop something early, you can get an exaggerated benefit that isn’t real,” because less positive evidence only emerges later, Topol said.', 'Stopping the studies early also could prevent researchers from recruiting more minority volunteers. So far, only about 1 in 5 trial participants are Black or Hispanic. Given that Blacks and Hispanics have been hit harder than other groups by the pandemic, Topol said, it’s important that they make up a larger part of vaccine trials.', 'Ending vaccine trials early also carries safety risks, said Paul Offit, M.D., a vaccine developer who serves on an NIH advisory panel on COVID vaccines and treatments.', 'A smaller, shorter trial could fail to detect important vaccine side effects, which could become apparent only after millions of people have been immunized, said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.', 'Researchers will continue to follow vaccinated volunteers for a full year to look for long-term side effects, Redfield said.', 'And Fauci acknowledged that cutting a trial short could undermine public confidence in COVID vaccines.

Hope and desire for a vaccine to end the global devastation is growing with each passing week.', 'Almost every day, I hear people making plans around the eventual arrival of a coronavirus vaccine—office reopenings, rescheduled weddings, family reunions and international travel. In recent weeks, colleagues and friends have asked me with growing urgency: “When will we have a vaccine? Will it be any good?”', 'At the same time, other friends have been telling me, “When I hear that this is going to be the fastest vaccine developed ever, that doesn’t make me feel good—it makes me feel nervous that they’re going to cut corners.”', 'These questions and concerns resonate with me. I, too, want a vaccine, but I want reassurance that it’s truly safe and effective. So I talked to a dozen people in the vaccine world: scientists, pediatricians, pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as staff at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration.', 'Let me tell you this up front: If you’re imagining there’ll be one golden day when a vaccine is approved and the pandemic will be over—Finally! We can all crowd into one another’s living rooms and resume choir practice again!—I’m afraid it won’t be quite like that. But it will be the beginning of the end.', 'There’s much to be hopeful about, and enormous challenges lie ahead. Let’s dig in.', 'Everyone I spoke to was optimistic that manufacturers would eventually develop a COVID-19 vaccine. This isn’t just because there are so many scientists and pharmaceutical companies working on the endeavor, and so much money being poured into it, though that also raises the chance of success.', 'The goal of vaccine developers is to mimic a natural infection as closely as possible without getting a healthy individual sick. There are many ways to do this. You can give a person a weakened virus or a dead virus. You can also show the immune system just part of the virus. Many manufacturers are creating vaccines involving only the “spike protein,” the part on the surface of the coronavirus that attaches to the human cell it is trying to enter. Once the immune system has learned what the spike protein looks like, when it encounters it again, as part of a real coronavirus, it should know how to defend itself.', 'John Mascola, M.D., director of the Vaccine Research Center at the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he is hopeful because our natural immune system, when healthy, is capable of handling the infection. “Most of the time, people recover from COVID-19, because their immune system eventually clears the virus,” he said. He contrasted the coronavirus to HIV, for which scientists so far have struggled to create an effective vaccine: “In HIV, the natural immune system is not effective and people get AIDS.” In this virus’s case, if we can mimic a natural infection closely enough, it’s likely that a vaccine will work.', 'There are some vaccines that are extremely effective, like the MMR vaccine: One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles; two doses (which is what’s recommended) are about 97% effective.', 'Other vaccines aren’t as perfect. The flu shot’s effectiveness varies year to year. During the 2019-20 flu season, it was about 45% effective at preventing infections, according to the CDC. The year before, it was just 29% effective.', 'The experts I talked to said that the flu shot was an outlier because of the rapidly shifting nature of the influenza virus. Because of its frequent mutations, developers have to make each year’s vaccine based on educated guesses on what strains of the flu virus will be circulating next year. Sometimes, they misjudge, resulting in a vaccine that doesn’t exactly match up with the flu strains that are most prevalent the following season.', '“Influenza changes year in, year out, and the people who get it tend to be extremes in age—elderly and children—so you don’t tend to have as good an immune response,” said Nicholas Kartsonis, M.D., infectious disease and vaccines clinical research lead for Merck, which has two COVID-19 vaccine candidates that it plans to start in human trials this year.', 'One lucky break COVID-19 vaccine developers have had is that this coronavirus hasn’t mutated in any significant way so far, including, crucially, the part that is most visible to the immune system, that spike protein. So long as that remains true, the vaccine they make should match up with the virus that our bodies will encounter in the real world, meaning it’ll likely work as intended. Given the stability seen so far in the coronavirus’s genetic sequence, “I am hopeful that when we do develop a vaccine, it will provide long-term protection,” Kartsonis said.', 'When vaccine manufacturers talk about “effective,” there are two common definitions. One is preventing people from getting sick. The other is preventing people from getting infected at all. In the case of COVID-19, this could be a nontrivial difference.', 'We know now that many people infected with the coronavirus may be asymptomatic carriers, which means that they never feel sick or get symptoms like a cough or fever, even if they are, in fact, infected with the virus. So you can have a vaccine that is effective in that it prevents symptomatic COVID-19, but that doesn’t mean it’ll stop everyone from being infected.', 'Let’s be clear: A vaccine that can significantly reduce sickness would be fantastic. If a vaccine can reduce the severity of COVID-19 so that it’s far less deadly, decrease hospitalizations and minimize symptoms even for those who catch it, that’s a win.', '“In terms of what you’d expect for approval, it should at least be 50% efficacy against symptoms and 70% against moderate to severe disease, to keep you out of the hospital,” said Paul Offit, M.D., director of the vaccine education center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.', 'Even so, it’s important not only to measure what the vaccine does, but also for politicians, health officials and journalists to clearly explain to the public exactly what it is that the vaccine is capable of doing. If it ends up that the first vaccine to go to market is “70% effective,” we should be clear on whether it is 70% effective at reducing sickness or infection, so members of the public have the appropriate context and don’t feel let down if they are vaccinated and still get a mild case of COVID-19.', 'When experimental vaccines are tested, they usually go through three phases of clinical trials. The first phase is the smallest and focuses on safety, making sure that the product doesn’t have any dangerous health effects. The second is a little larger, continuing to gather safety data while testing if the vaccine can induce an immune response, producing antibodies in participants. The third trial is the largest, and it needs to be big enough to confirm that the vaccine is actually effective in the real world.', 'Moderna Therapeutics is currently expected to be the first U.S. manufacturer to start a phase 3 trial. Candidates by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson will follow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Moderna’s trial is planned to begin in July and will enroll about 30,000 participants. Half will get the vaccine and half will get a placebo, according to Moderna’s chief medical officer Tal Zaks, M.D. (I should disclose: Paul Sagan, chairman of ProPublica’s board, is also one of Moderna’s board members. That said, ProPublica’s board members have no say in what reporters write about, nor do they know about articles before they are published.)', 'The participants will be tracked carefully throughout the study. If they have any symptoms related to COVID-19, they’ll get tested to see if they have contracted the virus. The participants will also get blood drawn at regular intervals to get tested for antibodies, which will determine if they got infected but perhaps didn’t know because they didn’t develop symptoms.', '“But wait!” you say. “Doesn’t a vaccine also create antibodies? How can you tell by looking in a participant’s blood whether the antibodies come from the vaccine or from an infection that the vaccine failed to prevent?” Excellent question.', 'At least for Moderna’s vaccine trial, here’s how they’re going to tell the difference: Moderna’s vaccine is what’s known as an mRNA vaccine. Instead of using the actual virus or even a little bit of the virus, it uses a piece of genetic code, kind of like a recipe, that gives instructions for making the spike protein. Once injected into the arm and introduced into human cells, the cell’s protein-making factories read the recipe and manufacture the spike protein, churning out copies for the immune system to check out. The immune system should then create antibodies that correspond to the spike protein, like a matching puzzle piece.', 'When you get infected by an actual coronavirus, however, there are more parts to it than just the spike protein. Your body will produce other antibodies that match up with other parts of the virus, including what’s called the nucleoprotein, found inside the virus. We can also measure for those antibodies in a trial participant’s blood, the NIH’s Mascola explained. So if we find so-called NP antibodies, that means you’ve been infected for real, because there’s no way you could induce NP antibodies from the vaccine alone.', 'The Moderna trial is designed to end when a predetermined number of people have gotten sick, according to Zaks. Then, the study investigators will count up the number of people that have gotten sick in the placebo arm and compare it with the vaccine arm. Hopefully, there will be far fewer in the vaccinated cohort.', 'There’s one more question that a phase 3 trial cannot answer: How long will protection last? Right now, we don’t even know if people who have gotten sick via natural infection have lifelong immunity. The only way to find out how long a vaccine’s protection lasts will be to keep tracking study participants and whether their antibody levels drop over time. We may end up needing periodic booster shots. Truly, only time will tell.', 'To give you a sense of what a blistering pace we are attempting to move at, consider that under normal circumstances, it typically takes 10 to 15 years (PDF) to develop a vaccine. Creating the HPV vaccine was a 15-year journey from key research findings in 1991 until the vaccine was approved, initially for the prevention of cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers, in 2006. Merck’s Ebola vaccine, one of the fastest ever to be approved, still took about four years from start to finish, according to Kartsonis.', 'The speed of the phase 3 trials depends on the rate of infection wherever people are enrolled. If there is a huge outbreak going on, people in the placebo group will get sick at a high rate, and the trial may be over in a matter of a few months. If infection rates are very low, however, the trial could drag on for months on end. Moderna hasn’t announced its trial sites yet, but it will have sites “well dispersed” in the U.S. and is considering international trials as well, according to a spokesman.', '“There have been some European countries that wanted to be part of our trial, and we said: ‘Look at your epidemiology, you’re a victim of your own success—there’s just not enough cases happening. It would take five years!’” Moderna’s Zaks said. “So speed here is going to be enabled by what we anticipate is ongoing attack rates. We expect there will be infections amongst the participants on our trial.”', 'Still, there have been discussions of some potential ways to speed up trials even more. One common proposal is to conduct what are known as challenge trials, in which vaccinated participants are deliberately “challenged” with the coronavirus to see if they get sick.', 'This idea was dismissed as unethical by some experts I interviewed. “We don’t have a treatment—we can’t guarantee to any volunteer that if we gave them a challenge with the actual virus, that it wouldn’t make them very, very sick,” said William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt Medicine. “That would make a lot of people very uneasy.”', 'The other shortcoming of approving a vaccine via a challenge trial is that because of the inherently risky nature of giving participants a live virus, challenge trials are typically very small. “That diminishes the safety database, and you need a large safety database to give us comfort to communicate to the public that we think that this is a safe vaccine,” Schaffner said.', 'Another potential would be to green light use of a vaccine based on expected benefit, if manufacturers can show it reliably generates levels of antibodies in study participants that are similar to those found in people who have been naturally infected. Not everyone is a fan of that idea—some experts I interviewed told me that immune responses aren’t always predictive of a vaccine’s real-world capabilities. (Read more about this discussion.)', 'In the phase 3 trials currently being planned, the vaccines will be tested in adults. People over the age of 55 are being specifically recruited, and it’s important to include them because the need for the vaccine in that demographic is particularly high.', 'One group that won’t be in the initial set of phase 3 trials: children.', 'This is for two reasons. First, as a safety precaution, the NIH’s Mascola explained. Traditionally, when running trials with an experimental vaccine or drug, developers make sure it’s safe in adults before moving on to children. Second, for the COVID-19 vaccine specifically, the most acute need isn’t in children.', 'This means that when the vaccine is first approved, it likely won’t be available for those under 18, because it hasn’t yet been studied in that population. However, Mascola said there are already discussions for how to run future trials for children. Moderna will eventually run trials in children, Zaks confirmed.', 'Another special population is pregnant women. They are also not going to be enrolled in the initial phase 3 trial for the Moderna vaccine, according to Zaks. But Mascola said that it’s essential that that population eventually be studied. “If we’re not able to immunize women of childbearing age, that excludes a large proportion of the population. There’s a strong interest in getting those studies done,” he said. “The FDA is encouraging companies/sponsors to include in their development plans studies that would provide data to support use of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy,” the agency said in a statement.', 'The FDA added that it “strongly encourages the enrollment of populations most affected by COVID-19, specifically racial and ethnic minorities.” African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, contracting the virus and dying at higher rates.', 'One strategy that everyone agreed was a safe way to save a whole lot of time without any risk to human health is what’s known as “manufacturing at risk.” This is one of the key components of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed, which is supporting five candidates with billions of dollars of federal funding.', 'Typically, drugmakers will manufacture only enough doses for clinical trials and make sure the trials are successful before starting mass production. Manufacturing at risk means that developers will instead begin mass production at the same time as clinical trials, which means that if a vaccine fails in human trials, they’ll have to throw away all the product they’ve made, wasting money and materials. But if a product is successful, it means that the minute its trial is completed, there’ll be millions of doses ready to go.', 'Manufacturing at a massive scale is no simple task. “If we’re going to immunize 300 million people in the U.S.—we don’t even do that with the flu vaccine every year—we need a lot of glass vials, we have to make sure we have printing supplies and paper to make the labels and package inserts, we need stoppers for the vials, and they all need to be made to a very high standard. All this in addition to the raw materials to the vaccine itself,” Schaffner said.', 'Pfizer and its partner, German company BioNTech, are planning to have a few million doses ready by the end of the year, and hundreds of millions of doses available in 2021, even though the first of their four vaccine candidates just began its first early-stage human trials in May. The companies are currently preparing manufacturing facilities in St. Louis, Andover, Massachusetts, and Kalamazoo, Michigan, as well as in Europe, according to Philip Dormitzer, M.D., Ph.D., Pfizer’s vice president and chief scientific officer for viral vaccines.', 'On the day that a vaccine is approved, you’ll find me jumping up and down in my apartment, cheering loudly enough to startle my neighbors. And then … I’ll keep on washing my hands, wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing.', 'Why? Because I know that when a vaccine is first approved by the FDA, there won’t be enough available for everyone who wants it. There will need to be a prioritization, with the vaccine given first to those who need it most: essential workers and the elderly. As a healthy adult who is fortunate to be able to work from home, I’ll be nowhere near the front of the inoculation line.', 'Distribution is going to be a massive challenge. “There’s a need to have in place a mechanism to ensure people who should get the vaccine get it,” Walter Orenstein, M.D., associate director of Emory University’s vaccine center, said. “We won’t have 8 billion vaccines. So who should get priority, and how should it get delivered? We will need to remove barriers to access, including cost and distance.”', 'In all likelihood, we’ll have several vaccines that come to market and are in use at the same time, because of the unprecedented need to vaccinate so many people around the globe. No one company has the manufacturing capability to make it all.', 'There may also be differences in what works best for different countries and populations. Some of the vaccines will require cold shipping or storage. Some will require two doses (Moderna’s is a two-dose vaccine, taken a month apart). All these variations will add to the complexity of delivery and distribution.', '“Since I have gray hair, I’m trying to remind my colleagues that in previous distribution and prioritization schemes, flexibility is very important,” Schaffner warned me. He has long worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice, which reviews data on vaccines and gives recommendations on which populations they should be used for. He is now on the COVID-19 vaccine working group. “Adverse events will come up that have to become investigated. There will be bumps in the road. War plans are great, until the war starts. Then you will have to be flexible.”', 'Vaccinating 15,000 to 20,000 people before approval should give regulators a large pool of data to help them understand what side effects are to be expected and help ensure that the vaccines that go to market don’t have any major safety issues.', 'But of course, 20,000 people isn’t 20 million or 200 million or 2 billion people.', '“When we have tens of thousands of people being evaluated, we can at least pick up safety signals for serious adverse events for the more frequent adverse events,” Orenstein said. “Now for very rare events, if it’s 1 per million, you’re not going to catch that in clinical trials.”', 'What everyone wants to avoid is a repeat of the mass immunization program following the swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix in 1976. After 45 million doses were distributed, the vaccine was found to be associated with increased cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause paralysis and sometimes death. Even worse, there wasn’t actually a pandemic—the program had been launched in fears that the swine flu virus circulating among recruits at Fort Dix would cause a catastrophic outbreak. In the end, there was no transmission across the U.S., and the vaccination program was canceled.', 'So there will need to be some sort of mechanism to track and monitor for rare safety events even after the vaccine goes on the market. There is already a program to do so, which is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, run by the CDC.', 'While it may be impossible for a phase 3 trial to catch a very rare potential side effect, Offit, of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, points out that “it’s not a risk-free choice to not get the vaccine, if the virus is still circulating.”', 'He added, “If the data were clear that in 20,000 people it appears to be safe and highly efficacious, then you should get the vaccine, because if you’re choosing not to get a vaccine, you’re choosing to risk getting a natural infection, which could be fatal.”', 'The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed has said it “aims to have substantial quantities of a safe and effective vaccine available for Americans by January 2021.”', 'Experts I’ve spoken to have ranged in their optimism about that timeline. The NIH’s Mascola said, “If a study is started in the summertime, it’s possible that by the end of the year we’ll have an answer.”', 'Luciana Borio, M.D., former FDA acting chief scientist and current vice president at In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit strategic investment firm, concurred. “Depending on the results of the clinical trials, I think we might see some vaccine become available before the end of the year, but most people will have to wait for 2021.”', 'Others were more cautious. Orenstein said he thinks there is a “real possibility” that we will have a vaccine by summer next year, “if everything goes well.”', 'Vanderbilt’s Schaffner said he prefers to avoid timelines altogether. “We’re making the same mistake we made back in 2009 when we developed the H1N1 vaccine. We made the same statements and then it took more time than people anticipated, and when it finally came out, the media all said, ‘It’s a late vaccine!’', '“So we overpromised and underdelivered in 2009, and we haven’t learned that lesson. We are overpromising now, and I wish we wouldn’t do that.

The Swiss pharma previously had co-development and co-commercialization rights to the drug in North America, Japan, the EU and several other countries under a $650 million upfront licensing deal signed in early 2021.', 'The news marks the end of a second immuno-oncology partnership between the two companies after they parted ways on BeiGene’s anti-TIGIT candidate ociperlimab about two months ago.', 'In a statement to Fierce Pharma, Novartis said a changing PD-1 inhibitor landscape led to the decision to terminate the tislelizumab agreement.', '“This decision will provide Novartis with greater flexibility for development of its unique, potentially transformational pipeline assets, notably in markets where there are already approved PD-1 therapies in desired indications that can support development of our novel IO combination programs.”', 'Without a Big Pharma partner, BeiGene will face a lot of pressure entering the complicated and crowded PD-1/L1 space, in which eight other drugs are already approved across various tumor types in the U.S.', 'During an interview with Fierce Pharma, Josh Neiman, BeiGene’s chief commercial officer for North America and Europe, didn’t articulate whether BeiGene will look for a new partner, saying that “it’s always hard to predict all of the future with certainty.”', 'This is also the second time BeiGene regained tislelizumab from a foreign pharma. Back in 2019, Celgene returned the drug in the middle of its $74 billion merger with Bristol Myers Squibb because of conflict of interest with BMS’ Opdivo.', 'Also Tuesday, BeiGene said the European Commission has doled out its first approval for tislelizumab, to be sold under the brand Tevimbra. The indication is previously treated esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the same one that’s suffering from a significant delay with the FDA.', 'With uncertainty hanging over the FDA’s review timeline for Tevimbra in the second line, BeiGene has filed a new biologics license application for first-line use. Tuesday, the company said the FDA had accepted the submission with a target decision date in the second half of next year. ', 'Neiman declined to comment on Tevimbra’s specific price in Europe but noted that BeiGene now has full control over pricing, while it was Novartis’ decision before. Typically, a drugmaker need to negotiate reimbursement with each European market.', '“Consistent with BeiGene’s overall philosophy, bringing innovative medicines to patients with a focus on not only providing the medicine but doing it in a way that broadens accessibility and affordability, we will certainly take that approach with tislelizumab,” Neiman said.', 'The shift means that BeiGene will inevitably need to expand its commercial team, Neiman said. The company currently sells blood cancer drug Brukinsa in the U.S. But BeiGene has said in the past that hematology is more concentrated compared with solid tumors, which require larger commercialization forces.', 'Pointing to how BeiGene built its commercial team around Brukinsa first in smaller indications, Neiman said “there’s a really clear path for us to be able to build out [tislelizumab’s] team in a way that really meets the scale of our initial indications, and then expand that thoughtfully over time.”', 'As for the pipeline, there will be no changes to ongoing tislelizumab clinical trials on BeiGene’s part because of the termination, Mark Lanasa, M.D., Ph.D., BeiGene’s chief medical officer for solid tumors, told Fierce Pharma. These include a phase 3 trial that pairs tislelizumab with ociperlimab and chemotherapy in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as a midstage study with a LAG-3 agent in colorectal cancer.', 'Under the original alliance, each party had freedom to develop tislelizumab with their own assets. For BeiGene, combinations with the PD-1 inhibitor “remain high priority,” Lanasa said.', 'Novartis has communicated that it wants to continue to use tislelizumab for some of its clinical trials, the BeiGene exec added.', '“Ongoing studies may continue under the current sponsors. Tislelizumab will be made available to Novartis for this purpose,” a Novartis spokesperson said in a separate statement.', 'When asked about whether Novartis still plans to have an in-house PD-1, the spokesperson said the company “will not speculate on future pipeline decisions at this time.”', 'In addition to those clinical trials, Novartis has also agreed to continue to manufacture tislelizumab as a contractor.', 'Tislelizumab has had a rough patch since Novartis signed on. In early 2022, the FDA rejected Eli Lilly and Innovent Biologics’ PD-1 inhibitor Tyvyt (sintilimab) in NSCLC over China-only data and an inferior comparator arm. It marked a change of course as the FDA’s oncology department had previously welcomed data from China to support regulatory reviews.', 'This turn of events forced Novartis to rethink its regulatory plans given tislelizumab also has multiple China-only or predominantly China trials. Last summer, Novartis disclosed that it wouldn’t seek a monotherapy filing for tislelizumab monotherapy in newly diagnosed NSCLC in the U.S. after receiving feedback from the FDA.', 'Also last year, tislelizumab as a single agent matched up to Bayer’s aging Nexavar in front-line liver cancer. BeiGene has talked to the FDA about that study, Lanasa said, but, “based upon the regulation, having noninferiority rather than superiority makes it a tough discussion with the FDA.”']","Sep 19, 2023 09:10am"

Bluebird aims to activate around 40 to 50 treatment centers for Zynteglo by the end of the year, he said.', 'As for Skysona, the therapy is less important to bluebird given the rarity of the disease. Skysona carries a boxed warning about blood malignancy, including the life-threatening condition of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which appears to be caused by the lentiviral vector used to deliver the gene therapy.', 'In July, two more patients from Skysona’s clinical trial experienced MDS, bringing the total number so far to five cases, Klima said.

It’s also setting up an outcomes-based warranty program. The warranty will reimburse government and commercial payers up to the full cost if Roctavian doesn’t live up to its treatment expectations. Partial reimbursement will be granted if an individual loses response to the therapy in the first four years after dosing.', 'In a recent health economics analysis, the drug pricing watchdog Institute for Clinical and Economic Review figured Roctavian would be cost effective at around $2 million per treatment under some commonly used standards.', 'Hemophilia A is more prevalent than hemophilia B, affecting about 1 in 10,000 people. But Roctavian is only allowed to treat those with severe disease.', 'BioMarin estimates that about 6,500 adults suffer from severe hemophilia A in the U.S. Besides, because Roctavian uses adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) to deliver a functional gene to produce factor VIII, only patients who test negative for AAV5-targeted antibody are eligible to receive the therapy. The company expects about 2,500 patients will be eligible to receive Roctavian.', 'Roctavian’s FDA-approved label now shows that 112 patients who got the gene therapy in the phase 3 GENEr8-1 trial experienced an average 52% reduction in bleeding cases per year through a median three years of follow-up. Most patients were still responding beyond three years without the need for regular prophylaxis, the company said.', 'The FDA reached the 52% number after removing certain events when patients also received FVIII prophylaxis, BioMarin said. The magnitude of improvement on yearly bleeding episodes is notably smaller than the 85.5% Roctavian has for its EU approval.', '“The FDA is labeling the product with an intention to describe the sole contribution of Roctavian to bleeding outcomes independent of confounding effects such as factor use,” BioMarin’s R&D chief Henru Fuchs, M.D., said on Thursday’s call.', 'When asked whether the reduced efficacy data would affect payers’ view of Roctavian, Ajer pointed to a 96.8% reduction in FVIII usage compared with baseline, arguing “that’s going to be a key driver of people’s perception of the economic side of the value.”', 'With Roctavian, BioMarin faces a unique challenge. Unlike the more than a dozen gene therapies that the FDA has approved so far, Roctavian is meant for a disease that has plenty of other treatment options. For example, Roche’s antibody drug Hemlibra has gained vast traction with blockbuster sales. So Roctavian’s initial sales ramp will be slow, SVB Securities analysts said.', '“However, we believe that BioMarin’s perseverance, time spent connecting with the medical community over a longer than anticipated time to market, and extended long-term data could ultimately help the launch,” the SVB team wrote in a note Tuesday.', 'The SVB team polled 18 U.S.-based doctors that treat hemophilia A. Most specialists are impressed with Roctavian’s efficacy and safety data, although their feedback suggests patients who are already on Hemlibra are less likely to switch.', 'Overall, the doctors suggested Roctavian could eventually capture about a quarter of all eligible severe hemophilia A patients at peak. The survey results reflect “glimmers” of enthusiasm for Roctavian, the SVB team said.', 'Before the FDA decision, the European Commission had approved Roctavian in August last year.

That’s almost the same level of penetration that Roche’s blockbuster antibody drug Hemlibra currently has within the group. For reference, Hemlibra reeled in 741 million Swiss francs sales from Europe last year.', 'Encouragingly, about half of the doctors have already started evaluating their patients to understand whether they are eligible for potential treatment with Roctavian, according to SVB’s survey.', 'Doctors’ positive attitude aside, BioMarin still faces the same coverage negotiation hurdle that tripped bluebird in 2021.

A third of the doctors said they had contacted BioMarin’s representatives, and that they were satisfied with the interactions. The survey was conducted in May.', 'Almost all doctors rated Roctavian’s clinical data as impressive, including on the gene therapy’s durability.', 'There are at least two problems, though. First, doctors viewed the need for steroids following Roctavian treatment as a potential obstacle to adoption. In the drug’s phase 3 trial, 79% of Roctavian patients received corticosteroids to cope with elevated liver enzyme levels after two years, the SVB team noted.', 'Doctors in Germany appeared to have the strongest concern over steroid use as all of them labeled it as either a moderate or significant impediment to patient adoption.', 'Second, some doctors were still figuring out the appropriate patients to put on the gene therapy. In Germany, where BioMarin intends to launch first, none of the surveyed doctors there has identified eligible patients.', 'This delay suggests that Roctavian’s launch might initially be slow in Germany, the SVB analysts said. But considering doctors in other countries have made progress on patient identification, and because of the positive opinions on Roctavian’s clinical profile, the SVB team anticipated the drug’s sales ramp could pick up.', 'Outside Europe, BioMarin is awaiting an FDA decision by June 30.

The phase 1/2 trial coded TRANSCEND CLL 004 has therefore met its primary endpoint.', 'Among those who achieved a complete response, the median duration of response wasn’t reached after a median follow-up of 21.1 months. No patients in that group experienced disease progression or deaths by the data cutoff.', 'The results will be presented during the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting on June 6. Bristol released the findings ahead of the meeting Thursday.', 'Breyanzi’s complete response data “are remarkable and represent a major step in bringing personalized, T-cell-based treatment approach delivered as a one-time infusion into clinical practice for a complex and historically incurable disease,” Tanya Siddiqi, M.D., lead investigator of the study and a lymphoma expert at City of Hope, said in a statement.', 'In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a BMS spokesperson said the company is completing a full evaluation of the data and look forward to discussing them with regulators. But how the FDA will perceive the results remains a question.', 'Breyanzi reached the 18.3% complete response rate in a group of patients who have tried a median five prior lines of therapy. Among that group, each patient failed on a BTK inhibitor such as AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson’s Imbruvica, plus AbbVie and Roche’s BCL2 inhibitor Venclexta. As BMS noted, existing treatments rarely provide complete, durable responses for these patients.', 'In a larger trial population, including patients who may not have tried Venclexta, Breyanzi registered the same 18.3% complete response rate.', 'But Breyanzi’s primary efficacy data came from just 49 patients. What’s more, the med’s overall response rate, at 42.9%, wasn’t statistically significant. Among the responders, the median duration of response was 35.3 months.', 'Noah Berkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., senior VP of hematology development at BMS, argued that compared with overall response, the rate of complete responses is more important. Gaining durable complete responses can allow doctors to “begin to start thinking about whether patients are really cured or not,” he said in an interview with Fierce Pharma.', 'The FDA’s recent crackdown on single-arm trials could pose another concern for Breyanzi’s regulatory pathway in CLL. As FDA’s oncology chief Richard Pazdur, M.D., has said at various occasions in the past year or so, single-arm trials can sometimes send misleading signals because they lack a comparator to help benchmark an experimental drug’s efficacy and safety.', 'The FDA has granted approvals to cancer therapies based on tumor shrinkage data from single-arm trials before, including for CAR-T therapies. After one such study, Breyanzi got its initial approval in third-line large B-cell lymphoma in 2021 based on a 73% response rate, including 53% of complete responses, derived from 256 patients.', 'But compared to those applications, Breyanzi’s current CLL data set is small and its magnitude of benefit is much less impressive.', 'On the flip side, according to Berkowitz, no drug can currently deliver a complete response in these patients. So, an 18.3% complete response rate—albeit coming from a small, single-arm study—might suffice for accelerated approval in a patient population that has run out of treatment options.', 'In a statement to Fierce Pharma, the BMS spokesperson noted that these heavily pretreated CLL/SLL patients have no standard of care, and that the T cell dysfunction in CLL/SLL has historically make it difficult to develop a T cell-based therapy.', 'In pretreated CLL, Breyanzi could end up facing competition from Eli Lilly’s oral, reversible BTK inhibitor Jaypirca. In the phase 1/2 BRUIN trial, Jaypirca induced a 79% overall response rate in 100 CLL/SLL patients who have failed a median five prior lines of therapy including both BTK inhibitor and BCL2 inhibitor. But the Lilly drug saw no complete responders.', 'Instead of filing for approval based on that phase 1/2 study, Lilly believes Jaypirca can vie for an approval in CLL/SLL based on a randomized phase 3 trial dubbed BRUIN CLL-321, a Lilly spokesperson told Fierce Pharma. That phase 3 study is testing Jaypirca against physician’s choice of combo therapies in patients who have failed on at least a BTK inhibitor.', 'Breyanzi is offering potentially a one-time treatment option for patients, and BMS has a “substantial study demonstrating outstanding benefit-risk” in patients with pretreated CLL, Berkowitz said.

Based on the 74% risk reduction, Cowen’s statistical model now pointed to almost 40 months of median PFS.', 'Cowen analysts have suggested that Carvykti could enjoy “substantial uptake” if it can improve median PFS by two years.', ""In its own phase 3 trial, dubbed KarMMA-3, BMS' Abecma reduced the risk of progression or death by 51% over standard combination therapies. That trial enrolled patients who had failed on two to four lines of prior therapy—one line later than CARTITUDE-4."", 'Another key difference between the two studies is that the Abecma trial enrolled patients who had failed on—and most were refractory to—three different classes of therapies. The Carvykti trial only required resistance to BMS’ Revlimid.', 'Based on KarMMA-3, the FDA has accepted an application for Abecma for earlier treatment of myeloma, with a target decision date set for Dec. 16. Both Abecma and Carvykti are currently only approved in the U.S. as fifth-line therapies.', 'Phipps expects Caryvkti could get an FDA approval one line earlier than Abecma because CARTITUDE-4 enrolled a meaningful number of patients who had just one prior line of treatment.', 'Although the two trials are different, the “results for Carvykti across the board continue to look like the drug will eventually be a headwind to Abecma adoption,” Phipps said. Cowen’s earlier estimates also suggest Carvykti will become the leading BCMA CAR-T drug.', 'Wall Street’s view of the two therapies also matches the drugmakers’ respective estimates for their own products. J&J has put Carvykti’s peak sales potential at above $5 billion, while BMS figures Abecma sales could reach around $1 billion.', 'The leaked CARTITUDE-4 data showed other bright spots for Carvykti. The drug showed a much higher rate of complete response compared with control (73% vs. 22%) as well as a higher rate of no minimal residual disease (61% vs. 16%). Both markers indicate long-term benefits.', ""All Carvykti batches were successfully made without manufacturing failures for this trial. That's significant, because current reports indicate around 30% out-of-specification rates for commercial doses of Carvykti."", 'In terms of safety, only 1% of Carvykti takers experienced grade 3 cytokine release syndrome. No grade 4 or 5 episodes were recorded.', 'Despite the strong data from Carvykti, William Blair’s Phipps believes Abecma won’t be affected in the near term. That’s because both therapies are in short supply in late-line treatment. The companies can basically sell all the doses that they can make.', 'Meanwhile, J&J and Legend just recruited another cell therapy veteran, Novartis, to help manufacture Carvykti for clinical trials outside of China. However, given the tech transfer and the requirement for FDA approval of the new manufacturing site, Phipps thinks the deal could take several years to fully affect supply.', 'Showing a sign of improvement in manufacturing capacity, Carvykti raked in $72 million sales in the first quarter of 2023, J&J and Legend said Tuesday. The number was up from $55 million in two consecutive quarters in the second half of 2022.', 'Legend’s stock price jumped nearly 20% in Wedensday morning’s trading, pushing the Chinese biotech’s market cap across the $10 billion threshold.

Following the watchdog’s rejection of Yescarta in 2018, NICE reviewed new evidence to reach its amended conclusion. The latest review included clinical data from patients who received the drug through a previous U.K. coverage framework leveraging the country’s Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF)."", 'Yescarta’s U.K. coverage odyssey began shortly after twin European approvals for the therapy and its rival Kymriah back in June 2018. Just one day after the European Union cleared the way for Gilead’s cell therapy, NICE stiff-armed the drug on account of its high price.', 'The drama didn’t stop there.

But Novartis’ momentum was short lived. Roughly two weeks later, NICE batted Kymriah back in the same indication in adults over cost concerns.', ""Then, in a surprise twist, Gilead's Yescarta beat Kymriah to coverage through the specialized Cancer Drugs Fund. Under the CDF, officials grant access to new therapies while they collect additional evidence about benefits and risks. "", 'All the while, Kymriah wasn’t far behind, snagging a similar CDF arrangement in January of 2019.', 'With Thursday’s decision, meanwhile, Gilead’s med seems to have snagged an edge over Kymriah. Overall, NICE estimates there are some 5,500 people in England diagnosed with DLBCL each year.  Thursday’s recommendation opens the door to Yescarta for some “hundreds of people” in the country, the cost watchdog said. That exact patient pool, according to Gilead, numbers around 450 people.', 'NICE’s latest analysis suggests patients on Yerscarta live longer than people on chemotherapy alone, plus, Yescarta patients enjoy more time before their condition worsens.

And despite increasing Big Pharma investments in the area, Ipsen CEO David Loew believes his company can hold its own as a midsize player.', 'Ipsen is “not at all afraid” of competition from Big Pharma companies, Loew, a former Sanofi Pasteur chief, said in an interview last week on the sidelines of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. “What really matters is to be focused, to be excellent in execution.”', 'The chief executive pointed to Ipsen’s top seller, Somatuline, which is used to treat the rare hormonal disorder acromegaly and the rare cancer-related carcinoid syndrome, as well as endocrine tumors. The drug has been more widely used than Novartis’ Sandostatin, Loew said.', 'But the biggest problem for Ipsen these days is Somatuline’s loss of patent protection. In the third quarter of 2022, Somatuline sales dropped 10% year-over-year to 312 million euros.', 'That’s why Ipsen, a company without an internal research engine, has been busy striking deals. Ipsen added 16 new assets over the past 18 months through dealmaking, the company said at JPM.', 'The Albireo deal is centered on Bylvay, the first approved treatment for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, a rare inherited liver condition. The bile acid modulator is also in clinical testing for other rare liver diseases.', ""Bylvay is a nice fit with Ipsen's elafibranor, Loew said. Ipsen licensed elafibranor from Genfit late 2021 as part of a long-term collaboration, with a phase 3 readout in previously treated primary biliary cholangitis expected in early 2023. In addition, Ipsen also holds certain ex-U.S. rights to Exelixis’ liver cancer drug Cabometyx."", 'Although rare diseases and liver disease are “quite attractive” to Ipsen, Loew said Ipsen is “agnostic” in terms of rare disease indications. But there’s one therapy modality that Loew doesn’t want Ipsen to enter just yet.', '“What we will not do right now is go on gene therapy, because we think it’s still charged with quite a lot of risk,” Loew said, pointing to multiple setbacks and safety-related hiccups seen in the field recently.', '“Science will come at one point ... where gene therapy or gene editing could become a new tool, and then we have to see, what is the time point we would get into this,” Loew said. “But for now, that’s not inside of our strategy.”', 'Loew joined Ipsen mid-2020 and quickly outlined a vision for the drugmaker to be a “leading global mid-size biopharmaceutical company” with a focus on oncology, rare diseases and neuroscience.', 'In neuroscience, Loew is more cautious about where Ipsen intends to play. Specifically, he said Ipsen will focus on niche conditions rather than large indications like Alzheimer’s disease. In a blow to Ipsen in this space, its mesdopetam just flunked a phase 2b trial. Ipsen got the drug mid-2021 through a deal with Swiss company IRLAB. The targeted indication is for uncontrolled movements in Parkinson’s disease patients, but the mid-stage study found the drug failed to significantly improve the number of hours participants with Parkinson’s experienced dyskinesia.', 'Meanwhile, Ipsen also expanded its oncology offerings last year with a $247 million acquisition of Epizyme. The deal gave Ipsen the lymphoma drug Tazverik.', 'Cell therapies and bispecific T-cell engagers have shown impressive efficacy in lymphoma, but Loew, who once served as Roche’s oncology head, thinks Tazverik has a role to play.', 'As Loew sees it, oncology has two distinct segments divided by large academic centers and community doctors. CAR-T cell therapies and T-cell bispecific antibodies require specialized knowledge and infrastructure, partly because of the cytokine release syndrome side effect they may trigger. But many patients, especially elderly patients, aren’t fit for these therapies. Tazverik, as an oral treatment, is “ideally placed to play a role there,” Loew said.', 'Tazverik won an FDA accelerated approval in previously treated follicular lymphoma in 2020, and Ipsen is testing the drug in combination as a second-line treatment.', ""Editor's Note: The story has been updated to reflect that mesdopetam has failed a mid-stage clinical trial.""]","Jan 18, 2023 10:55am"

If the drug eventually shows it could meaningfully stop or slow deterioration, it would be a “very, very significant medicine.” Novartis brought the drug into the fold through its acquisition of British biotech Gyroscope Therapeutics, a deal that closed in February 2022.', 'Meanwhile, Narasimhan has made cell and gene therapy a technology platform of significant interest at Novartis. In gene therapy, the company is advancing more than 15 in-house projects, with the Gyroscope candidate the farthest along, Narasimhan noted.', 'Recent slimdowns—including a Roche stake sale—have given Novartis additional cash firepower to ink deals.

607,"['The title of the world’s most expensive treatment has changed hands within one company in a month.', 'On the heels of an FDA go-ahead for gene therapy Zynteglo, bluebird bio has won an FDA accelerated approval for Skysona, or eli-cel, for the rare neurological disorder cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD), the company said Friday. The company is charging $3 million per treatment with Skysona, higher than Zynteglo’s $2.8 million, making it the priciest therapy in the world.', 'Unlike Zynteglo, a beta thalassemia therapy, bluebird won’t offer an outcomes-based payment for Skysona because the rarity and complexity of CALD makes such an arrangement “extremely challenging to implement for both bluebird and payers,” bluebird CEO Andrew Obenshain told investors during a conference call Monday.', 'The price tag reflects “the clinical benefit [Skysona] provides as an urgently needed treatment option to slow the progression of neurologic dysfunction in children impacted by progressive, irreversible and fatal rare disease,” Obenshain added.', 'Skysona is bluebird’s second gene therapy after Zynteglo in the U.S. Previously, the biotech had to pull both products in Europe and folded commercial activities in the region after failing to reach reimbursement agreements with local governments.', 'Because of their potential to treat life-threatening diseases with a one-dose treatment, gene therapies are very costly. Before Zynteglo and Skysona, the title of the world’s most expensive drug belonged to Novartis’ spinal muscular atrophy gene therapy Zolgensma, which carries a $2.1 million list price.', 'CALD is marked by neurologic decline, which can lead to complete loss of voluntary movement. Without treatment, about half of patients—primarily boys—die within five years of symptom onset. Skysona is allowed to treat boys 4 to 17 years of age with early, active CALD.', 'By bluebird’s estimate, ALD affect about 1 in 21,000 newborn males in the U.S., and 4 in 10 are expected to develop the cerebral form. This translates into, altogether, about 40 cases per year in the U.S.', 'The FDA handed out the accelerated approval based on data from two small clinical trials. The drug was found to be better than natural history data at preventing the emergence of functional disabilities or death after two years.', 'To confirm Skysona’s efficacy for a potential full approval, bluebird has rolled over the 67 patients treated with the gene therapy in the two clinical trials into a longer follow-up trial to continue monitoring safety and efficacy data through 15 years, bluebird Chief Medical Officer Rich Colvin, M.D., Ph.D., said on the call. Additional data from commercially treated patients will also be counted.', 'Right before granting the approval, the FDA also lifted a clinical hold that it previously issued in August 2021. The hold was in place after a patient who got Skysona developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a type of blood cancer. Altogether, three patients in Skysona’s clinical program showed MDS, which is believed to be caused by the Lenti-D viral vector that bluebird uses to deliver a functional ABCD1 gene into the human genome. Skysona comes with a boxed warning for hematologic malignancy.', '“We are confident that the risks of Skysona will be weighed carefully with the risks of other treatment approaches and the CALD itself, as families and clinicians make these complex and deeply personal treatment decisions,” Obenshain said.', 'Bluebird plans to make Skysona commercially available by the end of 2022 at designated treatment centers, initially only at Boston Children’s Hospital and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.', 'Besides the previous clinical hold on Skysona, the FDA also has an ongoing partial clinical hold on Zynteglo’s sister med, lovo-cel, in sickle cell disease. The agency put the temporary suspension in place in late 2021 following one case of persistent, non-transfusion-dependent anemia. Bluebird is still “in correspondence with the FDA,” and the company has no estimate on when the hold might be resolved, Obenshain said.', 'The two back-to-back approvals give bluebird two priority review vouchers, which the company plans to sell for around $100 million each to keep operations running. The European commercial setback and the multiple clinical holds led to a restructuring that bluebird launched in April.', 'Bluebird expects the overhaul will reduce its annual cash burn to $240 million to $245 million in 2023, Chief Strategy and Financial Officer Jason Cole said on the call. The company believes it has “sufficient resources to successfully commercialize Zynteglo as well as Skysona and to file the lovo-cell [biologics application] on time in the first quarter of 2023,” Cole said.']","Sep 19, 2022 10:55am"

The presidential order gives HHS and other federal agencies 180 days to provide policy recommendations to expand domestic biomanufacturing capacity for medicines and in other sectors.', 'The HHS has invested directly in drug and vaccine manufacturing in response to recent health crises. During the early days of the pandemic, Operation Warp Speed, in which HHS played a key role, offered financial support to the development and manufacturing of COVID vaccines. More recently, to combat the ongoing monkeypox outbreak, the HHS announced $11 million in funding to support domestic manufacturing of Bavarian Nordic’s Jynneos vaccine at contractor Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing.', 'Meanwhile, the new executive order is widely viewed as part of a strategy to reduce the U.S. reliance on China for pharmaceuticals and manufacturing of other biotech products.', 'Biden’s order does include a big focus on biosecurity amid increased geopolitical tension with China and after the COVID-19 pandemic served as a poignant reminder of the vulnerabilities in global drug supply chains.', 'For HHS, the agency said it will launch a biosafety and biosecurity innovation initiative in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health to “reduce risk associated with advances in biotechnology, biomanufacturing and the bioeconomy,” although the exact work of the initiative remains unclear. It will also prioritize investments in those areas.', 'Besides infrastructure, the executive order also calls for regulatory support for biotech R&D. In several measures that involve the FDA, the HHS said it will support development of FDA research programs for advanced manufacturing technologies. The agency raised the examples of novel analytics for bioprocessing and continuous manufacturing of biologicals.', 'The FDA currently has a research initiative to help better understand the science of advanced manufacturing. The program has backed 60 research projects, and the FDA has used the knowledge gained to provide industry guidance, according to an FDA post as of October 2021.', 'Last June, the FDA formally established the Center for Advancement of Manufacturing Pharmaceuticals and Biopharmaceuticals to improve collaboration between its two drug evaluation departments, one focused on traditional small-molecule and antibody drugs, and the other on live biotherapeutics and cell and gene therapies.', 'Under the HHS plan, the FDA will also provide opportunities for additional pre-submission interactions for drug, biologics and device manufacturers that look to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies.', 'The HHS will continue to support innovations in platform technologies, and cell and gene therapies are apparently among the agency’s priorities.', 'In its announcement Wednesday, the HHS highlighted the NIH’s Platform Vector Gene Therapy pilot project, which has been evaluating adeno-associated viral vectors as gene delivery systems since 2019. It also pointed to the CAR-T project at the Frederick National Laboratory.']","Sep 14, 2022 11:21am"
609,"['Gilead Sciences’ Yescarta didn’t get to celebrate very long as the only CAR-T therapy approved for large B-cell lymphoma following just one line of therapy. On Friday, Bristol Myers Squibb joined the game with an even broader approval.', 'The FDA has cleared Bristol Myers’ Breyanzi to treat newly relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). The nod comes less than three months after Yescarta became first CAR-T drug to enter the second-line setting and a little over a year after Breyanzi’s original go-ahead as a third-line therapy.', 'Though slightly later to the second-line market, Breyanzi boasts an advantage covering “the broadest patient eligibility” for primary refractory or relapsed LBCL, Nick Botwood, BMS’ senior vice president of U.S. medical affairs, said in an interview with Fierce Pharma ahead of the approval.', 'Gilead’s Yescarta is indicated for patients who are refractory to frontline chemoimmunotherapy or who relapse quickly within 12 months. Breyanzi’s new approval covers that patient population and includes a specific line about patients who aren’t considered candidates for stem cell transplants.', 'In the phase 3 Transform trial that supported the approval, Breyanzi cut the risk of event-free survival by 65.1% compared with standard chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant. Patients on Breyanzi lived median 10.1 months without disease progression or the need for further treatment, versus 2.3 months for the control group.', 'By comparison, Yescarta registered a 60.2% reduction on a similar event-free survival measurement in its own phase 3 trial dubbed Zuma-7. The Gilead result boasts a longer median follow-up of more than two years, while BMS’ Transform had only followed patients for a median 6.2 months.', 'Meanwhile, the FDA sweetened the deal for Breyanzi by carving out patients who aren’t considered candidates for stem cell transplants and loosening the eligibility requirement. There, Breyanzi is allowed for patients with refractory disease or who relapse after frontline treatment, regardless of time to relapse.', 'The broader label comes as a bit of a surprise given BMS only mentioned the Transform trial when Breyanzi nabbed an FDA priority review in February.', 'Both Yescarta’s Zuma-7 and Breyanzi’s Transform enrolled patients who were fit for stem cell transplant. But BMS apparently added to its application results from the phase 2 Pilot study conducted in transplant-ineligible patients. The company just made the data public a few days ago at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting.', 'In Pilot, 80% of second-line LBCL patients responded to Breyanzi and 54% achieved a complete response after a median follow-up of 12.3 months. Among the responders, the response lasted a median 12.1 months at 15.5 months median follow-up.', 'Up to 40% of LBCL patients have disease that is refractory to or that relapses after initial therapy, and half of them are not suitable to receive stem cell transplants because of age or underlying diseases, according to BMS estimates.', 'BMS has estimated the U.S. population of primary relapsed or refractory LBCL is around 14,000 patients. Counting on the CD19-targeting CAR-T therapy to reach other blood cancer settings, the company has said Breyanzi could reach over $3 billion sales by 2029.', 'Getting an FDA approval only marks the first step in Breyanzi’s second-line journey, and despite the narrow time gap between Breyanzi and Yescarta in this specific indication, Gilead is still ahead of BMS on several fronts given its multi-year head start in the CAR-T game.', 'For one thing, Yescarta’s second-line DLBCL use has already been added to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s guidelines with a category 1—the highest—recommendation. Breyanzi doesn’t have that partly because the Transform results haven’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal.', 'BMS has submitted for NCCN consideration and will have peer-reviewed publication filed soon, Botwood said. Backing from NCCN is important for reimbursement discussions.', 'On the manufacturing front, since BMS’ duo cell therapy launches last year, the New York pharma has suffered a production bottleneck for BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapy Abecma. The second-line LBCL use is expected to significantly boost demand for Breyanzi, raising the question of whether the company can make enough supply.', '“Based on the progress that we’re making, we are confident that our capacity will expand toward the end of 2022 to meet the needs of these patients,” Botwood said.', ""Cell therapy production requires a complex process to produce, including drawing a patient’s own blood, genetic modification and expansion of T cells before infusion back to the patient. On the turnaround-time metric, Gilead's drug also has the edge."", 'Yescarta boasted a median time of 16 days from blood draw to final product release, according to Gilead data as of the end of 2020. In contrast, Breyanzi’s product turnaround time ranges between 24 days and 33 days, depending on the manufacturing site, Botwood said.', '“We’re really committed to consistently and reliably delivering on our goals, and in addition, we’re extremely focused on continuous improvements around investing in efficiencies and optimization to lower the turnaround time without sacrificing quality or safety,"" the BMS exec said.']","Jun 24, 2022 11:11pm"

Because there are so many technologies vying for a voice, Schimmer argued it’s hard to “value potentially dozens of related platform companies and guess how they’ll interact.”', 'Typically, investors assign the value of a platform by comparing it to others, but analysts simply don’t have much confidence in the comparator to begin with, he said. As some pipeline companies like to put several preclinical projects together, it also provides less visibility. Then what about their lead candidates?', '“Companies with similar platforms tend to gravitate towards a similar set of lead indications to test and optimize their development skills,” Schimmer said. The problem with that is, a company’s value is thereby based on assets that face fierce competition, which could muddy the “bigger platform picture” even though they could take unique paths afterward.

Investment will also start to flood into these hot fields, and redundancy will swell, adding more challenge to differentiating between programs. That in turn creates a new problem in assigning a drug the proper valuation.', '“Now, not only are we trying to anticipate how big the market pie might be, but how many slices it will be broken into over time, what the relative proportion of each product’s slice will be, and the extent to which slicing the pie will shrink it due to price competition,” Schimmer said.', 'Speaking of competition, science is being pushed from academia into the industry very quickly.

Of course, each drug treats a unique disease, but when looking under the broader orphan label, “it’s clear that at some point society will not be able to afford to pay for them.”', 'As Schimmer sees it, that day may not be far ahead.

That portends more M&A activity to come in oncology, he said.', 'Overall, Goldman Sachs is optimistic that gene therapy developers and acquirers will work out the business-model challenge. In the new report, they argued that investors have not yet fully recognized the potential for gene-based treatments to “create new profit pools and disrupt the existing $1 [trillion] annual biopharmaceutical market.” Genome medicine, they predicted, will create a total addressable market of $5 trillion, “with the potential to expand further.”']","Apr 12, 2018 11:45am"

Still, the company and its production partner should be able to sort things out “relatively quickly,” Acer’s chief executive said.', 'Thanks to an incomplete contract manufacturer inspection, the FDA has slapped down Acer’s application for sodium phenylbutyrate for oral suspension in UCD, the company and its U.S. commercial partner Relief Therapeutics said this week.', 'An agency field investigator was unable to inspect a third-party production partner for the med, which also goes by the name ACER-001, according to the FDA’s complete response letter. The contract manufacturer’s facility “was not ready for inspection,” the FDA states in its letter, as quoted by Acer.', 'Now, ACER-001’s bid to treat patients with UCD—an inherited disease where ammonia builds up in the blood because of faulty or missing liver enzymes—is on hold until the inspection can be finished. The FDA has asked for written notification once the facility is ready for inspection, according to the CRL.', 'There weren’t any other approval issues at play in the FDA’s letter, Acer explained in a release. The regulator didn’t request any studies before a potential approval. The FDA did, however, ask for “additional existing nonclinical information” in the drug’s resubmission, though the CRL pointed out that this was “not an approvability issue,” Acer said.', 'Now, Acer and its unnamed manufacturing partner are already on the case, with the aim to tackle the FDA’s comments “as soon as reasonably possible,” the company said. Acer hopes to resubmit an updated new drug application for ACER-001 for oral suspension in UCD in the “early-to-mid” period of 2022’s third quarter.', '“While the outcome of the NDA review was not what we had hoped for, multiple rounds of labeling negotiations have already been conducted to date and we believe the recommendations raised by FDA can be appropriately addressed,” Acer CEO and founder Chris Schelling said in a statement. “We should be able to resubmit the NDA relatively quickly,” he added.', 'Should it eventually clinch a UCD green light, ACER-001, which is also in development for maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), would have to contend with existing treatments like Horizon Therapeutics’ Buphenyl. Acer’s med is a polymer-coated formulation of the same active ingredient in Buphenyl, sodium phenylbutyrate, which, when taken within five minutes, helps prevent the coating from dissolving, Acer says.', 'Acer’s drug is designed to lack a bitter taste and dissolve quickly in the stomach, too, which could eliminate one source of noncompliance with current UCD meds.', 'Buphenyl, for instance, must be taken with food. By improving the odor and taste of sodium phenylbutyrate, Acer is angling to enable its formulation to be taken in a fasted state. The maximum concentration of phenylbutyrate achieved by ACER-001 was higher when given in a fasted state, results from a 2020 bridging study show.', 'Horizon’s med Buphenyl, for its part, brought home $7.9 million in U.S. sales last year, Horizon said in its 2021 annual report. UCD affects about one out of every 8,200 births in the U.S., the American Association for Clinical Chemistry says.

Writing in the journal ACS Applied Materials, researchers explained how they have hijacked that resistance mechanism to develop a hydrogel that releases its antibiotic payload when exposed to beta-lactamase enzymes.', '“We’ve developed a bacteria-triggered, smart drug-delivery system,” Anita Shukla, an associate professor at Brown University’s School of Engineering, said in a statement. “Our hypothesis is that technologies like this, which reduce the amount of drug that’s required for effective treatment, can also reduce both side effects and the potential for resistance.”', 'Shukla, who led the material’s development, worked with colleagues to create hydrogels that degrade specifically in the presence of beta-lactamases. The researchers used a responsive crosslinker to enable the hydrogel to react to the enzymes and validated the approach in in vivo and in vitro studies. ', 'By encapsulating fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles in the hydrogel, the researchers showed that the rate of release of the payload tracks the loss of wet mass, indicating that the process is triggered by the enzymes. Hydrogels that lacked the responsive crosslinker remained stable and retained their payloads in the presence of the enzymes and the bacteria that produce them.  ', 'Shukla sees potential to translate the concept to the clinic and is working toward that goal. In humans, the technology could facilitate the development of wound dressings that quickly deliver an antibiotic in response to emergent infections but keep hold of the payload in other circumstances to minimize the risk of unnecessary exposure and drug resistance.']","Jun 14, 2022 07:15am"

There are 775 or more life science companies in the state of North Carolina that directly employ about 68,000 people, he pointed out. The state has another 2,400 industry-supporting organizations that employ about 200,000 people.

Asheville is another site that’s expected to come up in the next several years, he added. ', 'North Carolina has a long history in manufacturing, textiles and tobacco. Once the state realized those industries “were all of yesteryear,” it made a push to break into the biotechnology sector, Edgeton explained.

', 'As for North Carolina’s other perks, the state has a favorable climate, great industry support and a fairly low tax rate, Edgeton added. The most important factor for biopharmas, however, is access to a trained workforce, which the Biotechnology Center supports through efforts like customized training and certificate programs. ', 'The Biotechnology Center works with North Carolina’s colleges to create curriculums for life sciences trainees, which ensures the state’s workforce is ready to roll when companies move in, Edgeton explained. ', '“Over the past 40 years, North Carolina has become a global leader in the life sciences and biopharmaceutical industries thanks to our world-class universities, highly-skilled workforce and a supportive and welcoming business environment,” stated Chung. ', 'For employees as well, North Carolina provides an ideal venue. Given the sheer number of biopharma outfits setting up shop, a staffer could simply switch companies if they decide to call it quits somewhere, Edgeton noted.', 'When companies look at North Carolina, they see a state that’s “rich in ideas, rich in talent and rich in quality of life,” he said.', 'Another important factor? Real estate is still a bit cheaper in North Carolina than in many other parts of the country, he added.', 'Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego were still the nation’s top three life sciences clusters as of the middle of 2021, according to a report by real estate services and investment firm CBRE. “Rents continue to grow quickly, particularly in ascendant markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.-Baltimore,” CBRE said.

', 'Meanwhile, one need only hit the road to see how cosmopolitan North Carolina is becoming. “We have more tags around our state when you’re driving across the state now than you used to see,” Edgeton pointed out. While it used to be mostly North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia cars, he’s now seeing license plates from places like California, New York and New Jersey. “So, people are, I think, leaving those markets and coming to these markets,” Edgeton said.']","Mar 8, 2022 08:20am"

If the virus evolves, creating a mismatch between circulating strains and the vaccine composition, it can lead to lower effectiveness.', 'But for this season, scientists perceive a different problem. Flu viruses didn’t significantly change after the vaccine composition was determined, the CDC’s most recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report reported, and a preliminary analysis of the Australian data suggests that the low effectiveness was not primarily due to any difference between the vaccine strain and circulating viruses. Instead, it seems to be the egg-based vaccine production technology that caused the mismatch, according to the team.', '“[C]irculating A(H3N2) viruses are antigenically less similar to egg-grown A(H3N2) viruses used for producing the majority of influenza vaccines in the United States,” the CDC report said.', ""RELATED: Industry's favored flu shot production process hurt efficacy last year: study"", ""In fact, a recent study has already attributed last year's low flu shot efficacy to the egg-based production process, a theory that the NEJM study supports. As the earlier group of researchers concluded, flu viruses propagated in eggs undergo certain changes in the hemagglutinin protein—the primary target of neutralizing antibodies—and that could negatively impact our body’s virus-killing responses."", 'FEATURED EVENT', '14-16 November 2023', 'London, UK', 'With that, scientists now stress the importance of a universal flu vaccine and are championing new paths away from the egg-based manufacturing process.', 'Recombinant and cell-based platforms are two other vaccine technologies currently available. Sanofi, through its recent acquisition of Protein Sciences, markets the Flublok family, the only recombinant-based flu shots approved in the U.S., and the platform grows vaccine virus in cells. Seqirus’ Flucelvax is also the only FDA-approved cell-based flu vaccine. Seqirus just started manufacturing its entirely cell-based flu vaccines on a commercial scale this season.', ""In a statement sent to FierceVaccines, Sanofi Pasteur's associate VP and North America regional medical head, David Greenberg, M.D., noted that no clinical studies have conclusively proved that cell-culture vaccines are more effective. He also pointed out that, with 150 million doses of flu shots needed each year in the U.S. alone, “egg-based vaccine production remains the most reliable, time-proven method and represents the vast majority of vaccines used globally to help prevent influenza.”"", 'But the company also said it “continuously assesses new technologies to improve production capabilities,” including the benefits of Flublok and development of a universal flu vaccine that would be effective despite antigenic drift and mismatch.', 'RELATED: Seqirus’ adjuvanted quadrivalent flu vaccine shows better protection for young children', 'Published last month, the University of Pennsylvania study found that most people among the studied group who had strong antibody responses in the 2016-17 season had received the recombinant flu vaccine.', 'Regardless, before alternative technologies become widely adopted, experts still encourage people to get the flu shots, even if it only offers 10% protection. “However imperfect, though, current influenza vaccines remain a valuable public health tool, and it is always better to get vaccinated than not to get vaccinated,” the NEJM authors wrote.', ""Editor's Note: The story has been updated with two statements from Sanofi Pasteur.

But for the company’s next phase of growth in immunology, the Swiss pharma giant is targeting a slew of indications that remain underserved.', 'Cosentyx has been successful in psoriasis, a common battleground among drugmakers. But Novartis decided it’s “not going to play this game anymore” and is angling the blockbuster IL-17A inhibitor—and much of the rest of its immunology portfolio—at less cultivated indications, which Chief Commercial Officer Marie-France Tschudin said are still “lost out there.”', '“Instead of investing in trials that are replicating the same level of knowledge, we feel that the medical community is asking us for something else,” Tschudin said in an interview with Fierce Pharma.', 'Common diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases are almost absent in Novartis’ current immunology pipeline. Instead, it’s full of less familiar targets such as hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Sjögren’s syndrome and chronic spontaneous urticaria.', 'Cosentyx recently gained a thumbs-up from drug reviewers at the European Medicines Agency for the inflammatory skin disease HS, setting the stage for a formal European approval in the coming weeks. An FDA decision is also expected in the second half of this year. If all goes to plan, Cosentyx would become only the second FDA-approved HS treatment after a go-ahead for AbbVie’s Humira eight years ago.', 'A prevalent but under-diagnosed and under-treated disease, HS affects 1 in 100 people worldwide. Only 5% of patients are treated with biologics today, Tschudin said. That translates into around 200,000 patients each in the U.S. and Europe.  ', 'A sizable market opportunity lies ahead. But can Cosentyx capture it?', 'One reason for the low diagnosis and treatment rates is a lack of efficacious therapies, Tschudin argued. Specifically, a durable response, marked by sustained pain relief, remains a huge unmet need for patients.', 'Novartis recently unveiled 52-week data for Cosentyx in HS. The drug’s response rate—as measured by inflammatory lesion and skin abscesses on a marker called HiSCR—reached 55% after one year. About half of patients on Cosentyx had a meaningful reduction in HS-related pain.', 'FEATURED EVENT', '14-16 November 2023', 'London, UK', 'But a competitor—an arguably more efficacious one, according to experts interviewed by SVB Securities analysts—could pose a threat. That drug is UCB’s IL-17A/F inhibitor Bimzelx.', 'Tschudin argued that by “coming in first, being a tried and tested medicine,” Cosentyx could still capture a meaningful portion of the HS market. She said Bimzelx, after a European nod in August 2021 to treat plaque psoriasis, has only gained less than 2% of the market share there.', 'To Tschudin, the key to Cosentyx’s success in HS will be to get patients on treatment early in the course of their disease.', '“If we can tackle the disease with an efficacious medicine from the get-go, you actually have the longest-lasting impact on that patient.”', 'But targeting a biologic-naïve population won’t be easy, especially now that cheap Humira biosimilars are available. And, as the experts told SVB, payer coverage often determines a patient’s treatment for HS.', ""Easy patient access is another area where Cosentyx could compete, Tschudin said, given the drug's legacy in the market."", 'As for Novartis’ launch strategy, the company plans to initially target physicians who already treat HS and “start giving them experience with the medicine,” Tschudin said. Novartis hopes that once doctors witness the drug’s efficacy and durable response, Cosentyx will gain more interest.', 'Novartis hopes the HS indication, plus expansions in Europe and China, can lift Cosentyx out of a lull in 2024 to eventually reach the company’s $7 billion peak sales goal for the drug. After a surprise 9% revenue drop during last year’s fourth quarter, Cosentyx’s first-quarter sales were down 4% because it treated a greater proportion of Medicaid patients and because of inventory dynamics. Tough competition from the likes of AbbVie’s Skyrizi and Rinvoq also likely didn’t help.', 'As for Novartis’ broader immunology pipeline, Tschudin said she’s most excited about rapcabtagene autoleucel, a CD19-targeted CAR-T therapy that Novartis is developing for both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and lupus nephritis. The company believes that engineered T cells can take down B cells that cause autoimmune reactions.', 'During Novartis’ first-quarter earning call, CEO Vas Narasimhan named immunology a “top priority” for the company’s CAR-T program. Novartis has also designed trial protocols to test the therapy across multiple immunology indications once it gets the go-ahead from regulators, he said.', 'There are challenges. Other companies such as Kyverna Therapeutics and Cabaletta Bio are also working on cell therapies for autoimmune disorders. And, while the high price of a one-time therapy to treat cancer may be acceptable, the autoimmune market hasn’t yet been tested with the approach. Plus, manufacturing complexities could provide another hurdle.', 'Rapcabtagene autoleucel, also known as YTB323, is based on Novartis’ T-Charge platform, which allows for faster manufacturing turnaround and potentially more energetic T cells by moving most of the cell expansion to within the patient’s body rather than in labs. Tschudin said the company’s work on improving manufacturing efficiency could become a market advantage.', 'As for pricing, she suggested that the health economics calculations in some chronic diseases are not that different from cancer.', '“I think having a one-time treatment that we can make affordable to the healthcare system, that’s going to be absolutely a winning proposition,” Tschudin said.', 'While a large proportion of Novartis’ immunology pipeline targets underserved, less explored indications, the company does have BTK inhibitor remibrutinib in late-stage testing for multiple sclerosis (MS). The future of the BTK approach in MS is, however, in question after a series of safety-related setbacks from Sanofi and Merck KGaA, plus Biogen’s decision to back out from the field.', 'Novartis is closely following patients in remibrutinib’s clinical trials, although it hasn’t seen any concerning signals so far, Tschudin said.', 'Chronic spontaneous urticaria, also known as chronic hives, is remibrutinib’s lead indication. That phase 3 trial is up for a primary analysis in the second half of this year and could deliver final data in 2024.', '“The reality is that there are tens of diseases out there where patients don’t have a lot of options,” Tschudin said.

And an influential drug cost watchdog has an early idea of how the treatment should be priced to be considered cost-effective in sickle cell disease (SCD).', 'Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics’ gene editing-based exa-cel—and bluebird bio’s gene replacement therapy lovo-cel—can be priced up to $1.93 million to be cost-effective, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review said in a draft report (PDF) published Wednesday. The figure accounts for the drugs’ net prices after discounts and rebates.', 'The report comes shortly after Vertex and CRISPR last week said they had completed their rolling FDA applications for exa-cel in SCD and beta thalassemia with a request for priority review. If approved, exa-cel would become the first therapy based on the Nobel-winning CRISPR technology.', 'It’s not immediately clear how bluebird or Vertex-CRISPR will price their therapies. A Vertex spokesperson said the company is still reviewing the report. In a separate statement, a bluebird spokesperson said the company hasn’t set a price for lovo-cel and is currently focused on completing its FDA application.', 'During an interview with Fierce Pharma, ICER’s chief medical officer, David Rind, M.D., stressed that the cost-effectiveness analyses are preliminary and may change. ICER is gathering public comments until May 9 and pushed back its final report publish date to July 13 in anticipation of more data on exa-cel.', 'The novelty of the CRISPR technology doesn’t factor into ICER’s cost assessment other than to add some uncertainties about safety, Rind said. But “that is not in any way to detract from how incredibly exciting it is to have a CRISPR therapy and a more traditional gene therapy for this genetic disease that we’ve all been wanting to cure forever,” he said.', 'In ICER’s draft report, the organization said exa-cel and lovo-cel should be treated similarly because both have very limited clinical data. But it also suggested that future research may identify differences between the two therapies.', 'In lovo-cel’s registrational trial, 90% of 31 participants were free of any vaso-occlusive events between six months and 18 months after a one-time infusion, and 30 patients didn’t experience severe crises. In exa-cel’s case, only seven participants had 12 months of follow-up, and all of them were free of severe vaso-occlusive events, ICER noted.', 'ICER put exa-cel in a lower confidence rating in its comparison with standard of care because of a smaller dataset and the limited experience with the CRISPR technology.', 'FEATURED EVENT', '14-16 November 2023', 'London, UK', 'In a Thursday note, analysts at Evercore ISI said that exa-cel’s data pool is larger now. The team estimated that Vertex and CRISPR had 23 to 31 patients with 12 months of data when they completed the FDA submission.', 'Given that both gene therapies offer the promise of a potential cure, ICER compared them with standard of care over a lifetime.', 'The health economics reviewers figured the two therapies could cost between $1.58 million to $1.72 million under commonly used cost-effectiveness thresholds that only look at benefits within the healthcare system.', 'The range goes up to between $1.79 million to $1.93 million when considering broader societal value.', 'ICER is only offering an economic analysis to help people make their own decisions about value, Rind said. Pointing to how SCD disproportionally affects Black people, Rind said that it’s possible that some of ICER’s voting experts might suggest a therapy has good value under a higher range of cost-effectiveness because of historical discrimination and inequities in the U.S.', 'Under an even higher possible threshold, the drugs could be fairly priced at up to $2.32 million, according to ICER’s calculations.', 'Gene therapies typically cost multiple millions of dollars per treatment. Bluebird recently launched Zynteglo, a sister med to lovo-cel, at $2.8 million. Zynteglo is approved for beta thalassemia, a rare blood disorder that affects about 1 in 100,000 individuals.', 'Bluebird makes pricing decisions for its gene therapies “based on measures of positive clinical outcomes, quality-of-life improvements, and the potential societal impact of patients and families living their lives more fully, engaging in meaningful work, and using the health care system less,” the company spokesperson said.', 'SCD is more prevalent, affecting about 100,000 Americans, or 1 out of about 400 Black people at birth. By Vertex’s esimtate, treatment costs for severe SCD patients can reach around $4 million to $6 million over a lifetime.', ""Editor's Note: The story has been updated with additional comments from a bluebird spokesperson.""]","Apr 13, 2023 11:33am"

But the detailed data, recently rejected by the American Society of Hematology (ASH) for its annual meeting, might simply not matter that much to doctors and the drug’s sales.', 'Detailed data from the trial, coded KarMMa-3, has been published in The New England Journal of Medicine and is being presented at the EBMT-EHA European CAR T-cell Meeting Friday.', 'In the study, BMS’ Abecma cut the risk of disease progression or death by a whopping 51% compared with the standard regimen in multiple myeloma patients who have tried two to four prior lines of therapy.  The Abecma arm had a median 13.3 months without disease progression, versus 4.4 months in the control group.', 'The trial marks “a major milestone” as the first randomized study for a CAR-T therapy in multiple myeloma, and the investigators who saw the results were “ecstatic,” Nick Leschly, CEO of BMS’ partner 2seventy bio, said in an interview with Fierce Pharma ahead of the data release.', 'But Rahul Banerjee, M.D., a Fred Hutch doctor who specializes in multiple myeloma and cell therapies, said he had expected Abecma to deliver a much better median progression-free survival number than the 8.6 months it posted in the original KarMMa study in a later-line setting. “It was a little bit better. Not tremendously better. It kind of got stuck,” Banerjee said in a separate interview.', 'Still, as BMS’ cell therapy development lead Anne Kerber pointed out, there’s actually an overlap between the two trials’ patient population in terms of lines of therapies they had received. Perhaps more importantly, the KarMMa-3 patients had tried three different classes of therapies—immunomodulatory agents such as BMS’ Revlimid, proteasome inhibitors such as Takeda’s Velcade and Johnson & Johnson’s anti-CD38 antibody Darzalex. About 66% of patients had tumors refractory to all three drug classes, which indicates more aggressive disease.', '“I believe that if you’re tripe-class-exposed, it probably doesn’t matter how many prior lines you’ve had, because you will have a very poor outcome,” Kerber said.', 'The control arm’s 4.4-month PFS performance was also a little below Banerjee’s real-world experience, even though it matches some historical trial data. Banerjee said patients today are actually getting better outcomes based on improved care. But he shrugged off the difference, saying that he’s more focused on how Abecma itself performed.', ""In terms of Abecma's performance across different patient subgroups, Kerber noted that the therapy showed “very clear consistency”, including in those with high-risk cytogenetic features, who made up over 40% of all trialed patients. In patients with known high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, Abecma cut the risk of disease progression or death by 39%, versus 56% in the others."", 'FEATURED EVENT', '14-16 November 2023', 'London, UK', 'In another element that probably hurt Abecma’s data, some patients in the Abecma arm actually had fast progression and didn’t even get the CAR-T therapy, 2seventy chief medical officer Steve Bernstein said in the interview. The fact that some patients couldn’t get the drug on time could be related to how long it takes to manufacture CAR-T therapies.', 'While BMS, 2seventy and Banerjee all highlighted the transformational nature of KarMMa-3 in the development of myeloma CAR-T therapies, the data were mysteriously turned down for a late-breaking presentation at the ASH 2022 annual meeting last December, arguably the most important annual medical meeting for blood diseases. The absence triggered concerns about whether there are any weak points in the data.', 'Bernstein suggested that data or interest from the field aren’t the problems. The 2seventy exec noted that ASH isn’t just about myeloma or blood cancer—it covers an entire spectrum of blood disorders—so it needs some diversity in therapeutic areas. In multiple myeloma, ASH 2022 chose pivotal data from Johnson & Johnson’s potential first-in-class GPRC5D agent talquetamab for its press program, but no myeloma research was included as late breaker.', 'The release of the Abecma data comes as its direct rival, J&J and Legend Biotech’s Carvykti, just reported a trial success from a clinical trial that’s one line earlier than KarMMa-3. But as 2seventy’s Leschly pointed out, a comparison between the two agents simply doesn’t matter in the near future.', '“What people forget is that it’s a complete supply-driven market here, and it’s about delivering the best that you can to as many patients as you can,” Leschly said.', 'Leschly was referring to the manufacturing bottleneck that Abecma and Carvykti share. Both therapies showed strong data in late-line myeloma, where they are approved for use after four or more lines of prior treatment. This triggered strong demand that’s far from being met. And while both teams are working to ramp up production, supply will likely remain constrained for years, Leschly noted. That means, the two therapies don’t need very impressive data to drive uptake—at least for now.', 'Fred Hutch’s Banerjee also raised the same question. Interest in both therapies is high, he said, but “the big issue is slots” and limited hospital beds to give these complicated therapies that require patient monitoring. The long wait lists mean that even if the FDA decides to approve the CAR-Ts in earlier lines of treatment immediately, it’s not going to change which patients doctors will put on CAR-Ts, Banerjee said.', 'In the meantime, over the long term, J&J-Legend and BMS are moving the CAR-Ts to even earlier lines of treatment. BMS plans to launch the phase 3 KarMMa-9 trial in patients who had an inadequate response to stem cell transplant. Kerber wouldn’t give an exact timeline for the study but said the treatment setting “truly address[es] an unmet need.” And J&J is running CARTITUDE-5 and CARTITUDE-6 in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible and eligible for stem cell transplant, respectively.

As the drug targets earlier treatment—and larger markets—the partners have decided to literally double down on production."", 'J&J and Legend will double investment in their Raritan, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, bringing the total to $500 million, Legend CEO Ying Huang, Ph.D., told investors during a conference Monday. The cell therapy manufacturing site currently makes Carvykti for the U.S.', 'Together with another factory under construction in Ghent, Belgium, J&J and Legend in the next few years “will be in a position to have a capacity that accommodates the $5 billion-plus peak sales projected by J&J,” Huang said.', 'With Carvykti, J&J and Legend are in a “supply-constrained environment” that’s driven by two factors, Huang explained. One is an industrywide shortage of lentiviral vectors, which are pricey components used to introduce the CAR construct to patients’ own T cells. That’s why the two companies have decided to bring viral vector production in-house, currently managed by J&J’s Janssen vaccines department. And they expect to come out of the shortage “in the near future,” Huang said.', 'The other factor, Huang said, is the capacity, or slots, to engineer and culture therapeutic T cells. This involves multiple expansion efforts, including the physical build-out of the New Jersey manufacturing facility, Huang said, and that’s what the new investment is about.', 'The announcement came weeks after Carvykti’s BCMA-targeted CAR-T rival, Bristol Myers Squibb and 2seventy bio’s Abecma, touted a first-in-class phase 3 win in multiple myeloma patients who had failed two to four prior lines of therapy. The positive KarMMa-3 readout could potentially move Abecma into the third line, while both Abecma and Carvykti are currently only approved as fifth-line treatments.', 'Abecma’s latest success clearly gives Legend and J&J confidence that Carvykti’s CARTITUDE-4 trial in an even earlier population that has undergone one to three prior lines of therapy could succeed, as well. CARTITUDE-4 finished enrollment in late 2021.', 'By Legend’s estimate, a second-line multiple myeloma indication based on CARTITUDE-4 represents about 36,000 patients in the U.S., three times that of Carvykti’s current fifth-line opportunity, Steve Gavel, Legend’s vice president of global cell and gene therapy commercial development, said during the conference.', 'With that potential “major inflection point” in mind, J&J and Legend plan to increase the number of Carvykti’s designated treatment centers to around 70 to 80 from the current 40 with the extra manufacturing capacity in place, Gavel said. Because of limited manufacturing capacity, J&J and Legend have adopted a phased launch strategy to gradually ramp up availability to more treatment sites.', 'FEATURED EVENT', '14-16 November 2023', 'London, UK', 'But limited capacity is just one challenge in making Carvykti. During early launch days, J&J and Legend experienced a higher rate of manufacturing failure than they did in the CARTITUDE-1 trial used to support Carvykti’s existing FDA approval, Huang said.', 'The product release specification for commercial Carvykti that the FDA requires is more stringent than what was used in the clinical study, Huang noted. Besides, investigators screened patients to decide eligibility for the clinical trial, but patient baseline characteristics are more diverse in the real world. And a patient’s baseline health status affects the viability and the number of T cells collected, Huang said.', 'In the last few months, J&J and Legend have seen an “encouraging trend” in terms of the out-of-specification rate in its manufacturing processing, and the two firms are working hard to fine-tune manufacturing protocol to improve the success rate, Huang added. “I think at this point, we feel very confident that we will be able to overcome this.”', 'But one team of analysts appears less optimistic. Based on Legend’s comments, SVB Securities analysts in a Tuesday note decided to increase their cost-of-goods-sold estimates for BCMA-targeted CAR-T products over the long term to 35% from the original 15%. Higher costs mean lower profit.', 'Meanwhile, J&J and Legend have already started clinical trials pushing Carvykti into the front-line setting. Altogether, 64,000 patients are newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year across the U.S., the EU and Japan, according to Legend. The CARTITUDE-5 trial is in newly diagnosed myeloma patients who are ineligible for or don’t intend to get stem cell transplant.

Champeaux is situated blocks away from the Louvre, the famed Paris museum that houses arguably the most recognizable painting ever, Leonardo da Vinci’s ""Mona Lisa.""\u202fAnd, in the pharma world, you could make the case that Merck has a ""Mona Lisa"" of its own. ', 'But unlike da Vinci’s classic work of art, Merck’s medical masterpiece Keytruda isn’t guaranteed to hang on the walls forever. The drug’s patent expires in 2028—a nearing time bomb of revenue depletion—and there has been a slew of recent trial failures.  ', 'That spotlight on Merck’s drive to diversify was the context that loomed over this dinner—and Barr—as the team convened. Merck’s group of oncology investigators is now roughly 170-people strong, with about 100 at the dinner. There were some members of the regulatory team there, as well.  ', 'Corralling so many people into one place may also be emblematic of Merck’s larger clinical strategy.  ', 'In drug development, throwing clinical paint at a canvas to see what takes shape is not likely how a company would describe its work. There are a number of reasons for this, most importantly that your canvas is human life, and there needs to be a sound hypothesis that a clinical examination could reap some benefit. Still, for some of the sickest patients, particularly with cancer, risks are taken. It’s simply a function of progress.  ', 'Merck, in some respects, is leaning into risk-taking. And the dinner represented the all-hands-on-deck effort to develop the next generation of cancer therapies that will puncture the status quo, just like Keytruda has.', 'FEATURED EVENT', '14-16 November 2023', 'London, UK', 'To Barr, and by extension Merck, failure is merely the cost of doing business when you’re looking to pave new ground.\u202f  ', '“We’re perfectly comfortable with the fact that some studies are going to be negative,” he said. ', ""Barr compared drug development to a professional baseball batting average. “If you've got a batting average of 1.000, it means that … you're really omniscient or you've been very timid, and you've only taken the very low-hanging fruit.”\u202f  "", 'Keytruda is certainly established as one of the most formidable cancer therapies, setting an exceptionally high bar. Launching in 2014, the drug raked in a mind-boggling $42.65 billion (PDF) from 2019 through 2021. The explosive revenue is due in part to the expansion of its use over the years, with the drug now approved to treat more than a dozen cancers.\u202f ', 'That prowess makes Keytruda’s recent string of failures more noteworthy. Just in the last three months, there have been three significant flops. A trial testing Keytruda in combination with Eisai-partnered Lenvima in front-line liver cancer came up short. The immuno-oncology asset alongside chemotherapy also failed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. And Keytruda missed its goal in a head and neck cancer study.\u202f ', 'That dichotomy between Keytruda’s multibillion-dollar status and signs of deficiencies put an emphasis on the company’s ambitions. For now, the plan is twofold: Get Keytruda, a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, into earlier lines of treatment and continue to pursue a variety of combinations. ', 'Merck is designing new checkpoint inhibitors to mix and match with Keytruda, including TIGIT and CTLA4 inhibitors that are in phase 3.\u202f ', 'When asked at a press briefing whether the company had concerns in light of Roche’s failures with its TIGIT, Merck’s primary investigator, Marina Garassino, M.D., said too many conclusions were coming from that company’s interim analysis and that it’s too early to make conclusions about the target. ', 'As for CTLA4—validated in the form of Bristol Myers Squibb approved cancer drug Yervoy but a target that’s marred by high toxicity rates—Eric Rubin, M.D., senior vice president of oncology early development, said the company was very careful in its dose-finding study.  ', 'Merck also plans to narrow the cancer types that it tests the combination on. CTLA4 inhibitors generally don’t have a large effect as a monotherapy, so the strategy is to focus on those cancers where these assets have shown single-agent efficacy, like in renal cell carcinoma, Rubin explained.', ""As much as Merck’s leaders are projecting confidence about its ability to extend Keytruda’s life through combinations, it's not putting all its eggs in that basket. The company outlined its cancer pipeline at ESMO, and the largest bet outside of checkpoint inhibitors is in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). As a dual-faceted class of cancer therapy that combines a monoclonal antibody with cancer- cell killing chemicals using a linker, the hope is that ADCs add critical firepower to a cancer regimen.\u202f "", 'Rubin agreed “in some sense” with the notion that ADCs were a focal point of the company’s pipeline, given picking out the most important assets is the drug development equivalent of choosing your favorite child.\u202f ', 'Merck is looking to take ADCs to new heights. “The technologies [are] advanced there, where the sophistication for selecting tumor-specific targets has gotten better. The linker chemistry has gotten better,” he said. ', 'Merck has three ADCs, all in phase 2. Merck has full control of only one, zilovertamab vedotin, which is being developed for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors. The other two assets, ladiratuzumab vedotin and MK-2870, are being positioned against various solid tumors including breast and non-small cell lung cancers.  ', ""Rubin underscored MK-2870’s target, TROP2. Because it’s expressed in several tumors, “you've got the potential of having something like Keytruda that's active across many different cancer types,” he explained. "", 'The dive into ADCs is not stopping Merck from dipping its toes into still other modalities, however. The company is investing in immune agonists, cancer vaccines and cell therapies. Addressing cell therapies, both of which are in preclinical testing, Barr said cost and scalability remain hinderances to further investment. ', 'In talking about the patient-specific, or autologous approach, taken by companies with marketed cell therapies, Barr said, “We decided consciously not to be ... a Novartis or Kite/Gilead or BMS."" Rather, Merck\'s preference is to focus on the so-called off-the-shelf, or allogeneic, technique. ', ""Taking a 10,000-foot view on Merck’s larger ambitions, Barr said Keytruda taught the company to bust open the development gates when the evidence suggests that an asset is effective.\u202f“I think Keytruda taught us a lot of really important things from our point of view, which is when you have something that looks incredibly good, don't mess around, just blow it out,” he said. "", 'Naturally, this strategy extends into the other disease areas that Merck focuses on. In other words, the next Keytruda may not even be a cancer treatment.\u202f ', 'Barr noted his own excitement for the company’s recently acquired pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) med. Merck got hold of sotatercept when it bought Acceleron for $11.5 billion in 2021.  ', 'Pulmonary hypertension, a larger condition than PAH that affects millions of patients, could be where the company takes sotatercept next, Barr teased.\u202fAnalysts project peak sales could hit $2 billion. ', ""Barr described sotatercept as a “Keytruda-like” drug, saying that the company is now testing the asset in every stage of the disease. “And so you look at that, and you come to realize that when you have something that's unique, and really different … that's when you go big or go home.” ""]","Sep 29, 2022 03:35pm"

It wasn’t just a narrow miss by statistical significance: Patients in both groups who either got Kymriah or standard of care—which involves chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant—lived a median three months without a negative event that indicates treatment failure.', '', '', 'Kymriah’s complete lack of showing came in stark contrast to the more than 60% reduction on that event-free survival marker posted by Gilead’s Yescarta and BMS’ Breyanzi in the same second-line lymphoma setting. The data were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting.', '', '', 'FEATURED EVENT', '14-16 November 2023', 'London, UK', 'When Novartis first unveiled the flop in August, Cowen analysts said it “may be taken as evidence to support some physician views that Kymriah is less potent than competitors.” But Novartis doesn’t believe that Kymriah is inferior in any way, Jeff Legos, Ph.D., Novartis’ global head of oncology and hematology development, said in an interview.', 'As Legos sees it, Kymriah’s phase 3 BELINDA trial in second-line lymphoma was failure by a thousand cuts. Among the factors that might have contributed to the final outcome, Legos pointed to the long time to infusion with Kymriah as the “most relevant factor.”', 'For existing CAR-T cell therapies, a qualified medical center draws a patient’s T cells and ships them to a lab to be engineered to specifically fight cancer. In the BELINDA trial, the median time from the withdrawal of T cells to reinfusion of the final product was 52 days, Legos said.', 'By comparison, the median time from patient randomization to infusion was 29 days for Gilead’s Yescarta in its ZUMA-7 second-line trial, including five days to prepare a patient for the blood withdrawal, Frederick Locke, M.D., of the Moffitt Cancer Center and primary investigator of the study, told reporters during a press briefing.', '', ""RELATED: Novartis' Kymriah flops in earlier lymphoma use, where Gilead, Bristol Myers CAR-T rivals succeeded"", '', '', 'The time window to treatment is important, because patients in the Kymriah trial had very aggressive disease, with most refractory to first-line treatment, Legos explained. As a result of having a long wait, at the time of what Legos called “true randomization,” which was the actual treatment, the patient populations were already different between the two arms. That’s because the Kymriah group had more patients whose disease was already progressing or had a higher volume of disease, the Novartis exec contends.', '', '', 'What’s more, the BELINDA trial’s definition of event-free survival counts failure to achieve a response at the Week 12 assessment as a negative incident. But because of the long gap to treatment, some patients may not have adequately responded to Kymriah by that point, Legos said. Some patients responded to Kymriah after 12 weeks without any additional therapy, the trial investigators noted.', '', '', 'Further, Legos noted that patients in the Kymriah arm had some of the poorest risk factors that weren’t captured at the time of randomization, leading to some imbalances in patient prognostic characteristics between the two arms of the BELINDA trial.', '', ""RELATED: ASH: Bristol Myers' Breyanzi, Gilead's Yescarta lock horns in race to move CAR-T therapy to earlier lymphoma"", '', 'But even if Kymriah’s trial failure can be explained by the long time to infusion, product turnaround time is a key factor in CAR-T therapy.

The time to infusion was roughly evenly split between manufacturing and logistics in the study, suggesting that COVID-19 might have contributed to the extended timeline on the logistics front.', 'Manufacturing hiccups previously tripped up Kymriah’s launch in third-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) back in 2018. Industry experts Cowen recently spoke with said that the early manufacturing problems with Kymriah have made them more inclined to reach for Yescarta and that they perceive the Gilead drug as having better efficacy despite some neurotoxicity concerns, the analysts wrote in a report late September.', 'Now, the BELINDA trial results will likely solidify those opinions. Still, Jason Westin, M.D., leader of DLBCL research at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, said he wouldn’t rule on whether Kymriah is inferior to the other CD19-targeted CAR-T therapies given the flaws with the BELINDA trial.

That’s because its focus is shifting.', '', '', 'With a next-generation CAR-T platform called T-Charge, the company aims to reduce the manufacturing timeline for immune cells to less than two days and thus cut the overall timeline “from vein to door” by at least half, Legos said.', '', '', 'Besides a shortened timeline, T cells made from the platform are more potent and have better ability to self-proliferate inside the body, Legos said.

876,"['On the surface, it may seem that the higher the price of a new medicine, the harder it is for its developer to get a thumbs-up from drug-price watchdog Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER). For companies in the rapidly growing gene and cell therapy field, that would make ICER’s review a tough hurdle to overcome, particularly if the agency’s opinions take on more weight in determining insurance coverage decisions in the future.', 'But analysts at Mizuho Securities dug into most of ICER’s verdicts on gene and cell therapies to date and found a surprising trend: The institute’s reviewers have deemed more than half the products they reviewed so far to be cost-effective. And the evidence they used to reach those positive conclusions offers important lessons on research, development and pricing to developers of the next generation of gene and cell therapies, said analyst Difei Yang, Ph.D., the lead author of two reports Mizuho sent to clients last week, in an interview.', '“Clearly, they’re looking at the amount of time the patient gains but also the quality of life,” Yang said. Companies that put in the effort to provide robust data proving a gene or cell therapy could outperform the standard of care on both measures—head-to-head trials, solid evidence of long-term benefit and so forth—had a higher likelihood of a positive ICER verdict on cost-effectiveness, Mizuho found.', 'Makers of CAR-T cancer cell therapies have so far been much more successful at proving superiority over the standard of care than have manufacturers of gene therapies for rare diseases, Mizuho noted. ICER approved of the cost-effectiveness of the first two CAR-Ts on the market, Gilead’s Yescarta for lymphoma and Novartis’ Kymriah for lymphoma and leukemia, both approved in 2017 and launched at $373,000 and $475,000, respectively. And the agency has already said it will give the thumbs-up to the yet-to-be-approved multiple myeloma CAR-T cilta-cel from Janssen and Legend Biotech—provided that it is priced at $475,000 or less.', 'Only one of four CAR-Ts that ICER reviewed did not hit the cost-effectiveness threshold: Bristol Myers Squibb’s ide-cel for multiple myeloma, which was launched this spring with the brand name Abecma at a price of $419,500. A spokesperson for BMS griped at the time that ICER relied on “inappropriate modeling of ide-cel’s overall survival data and a misguided view of retreatment.”', 'ICER’s president Steve Pearson, M.D., cited “important evidence gaps” in the data available to the agency while it was reviewing the cost-effectiveness of multiple myeloma treatments.', 'Pearson said in an interview that ICER’s reviewers sometimes struggle to determine how data from what are often brief studies will translate to real-world outcomes. “We need to see longer-term data that we can connect to what we’re seeing in the short term,” Pearson said. “What we really want to see are patient-relevant outcomes, like how well they’re functioning and their quality of life.”', 'Often, companies fall short when it comes to providing data that provide a clear contrast between patients who receive gene or cell therapies and those who do not, Pearson said. “They may say [non-treated] patients would only have six months to live, but sometimes the comparison is just not that clean,” he said. “[Or] the [standard-of-care] data may be 10 years old. We know that care changes over 10 years.”', 'BMS took a step in that direction with another CAR-T in its portfolio, Breyanzi, which was approved in February for large B-cell lymphoma. Last week, it released trial data showing an improvement in event-free survival in patients who received the CAR-T treatment versus those who were treated with the gold standard, Roche’s Rituxan, high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.', 'FEATURED EVENT', '14-16 November 2023', 'London, UK', 'It is too early to define Breyanzi’s ability to extend lives, but BMS hopes the data will ultimately move the CAR-T earlier in the treatment regimen and set the product apart from lymphoma rivals Yescarta and Kymriah. Breyanzi was introduced at a list price of $410,300. ICER has not yet reviewed the product.', 'Mizuho’s Yang says being able to get the green light for earlier treatment may be the motivation for such head-to-head trials, and, ultimately, these data would likely bring ICER on board with high-priced cell and gene therapies, too. “The earlier you treat the patient, the better off they are. And the better off they are, the lower the net cost will be to the healthcare system,” she says.', ""RELATED: Bristol's new myeloma CAR-T needs a hefty discount to be cost-effective, watchdogs say while endorsing GSK's Blenrep"", 'Gene therapies, on the other hand, have received mixed reviews from ICER on cost-effectiveness. Take Spark Therapeutics’ Luxturna, which is approved for a rare inherited disease that causes blindness for those aged one year and older. ICER found that the product, which launched at $850,000, would be cost-effective if given to patients at the age of three but not if patients were dosed at age 15 or later, because by that time they would have already lost a significant amount of eyesight.', 'Yang attributed the verdict to the cost of care. “ICER tries to quantify how much a caregiver costs, so if the child is treated earlier, the idea would be that they’re more independent, they require less care,” Yang says. “If they’re treated at 15, a lot of that cost has already happened. And this message is consistent with gene therapy in general.”', 'But Pearson said ICER’s reviewers placed more weight on the overall value to society of preventing blindness. “There really are no significant healthcare costs for being blind,” he said. “But society saves money to a certain extent, because educational costs are lower, patients have full careers and higher earnings potential if they’re fully sighted.”', ""ICER initially balked at Novartis' $2.1 million gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Zolgensma, but it didn't approve of Biogen's SMA drug Spinraza either. Spinraza launched at up to $750,000 for the first year and half that every year thereafter, prompting ICER to ultimately determine Zolgensma is the lesser of two evils on cost."", 'BioMarin’s Roctavian, a hemophilia gene therapy, has hit some bumps on the road to approval, but ICER has already determined how it would be cost-effective. Using a placeholder price of $2.5 million, ICER estimated if the gene therapy is durable for a dozen years, it would save the healthcare system about $5 million per patient compared to chronically dosed factor VIII. “That’s an example of where gene therapy can really bring down [costs],” Yang said.', ""RELATED: ICER's blasted pharma pricing for years, but now drugmakers are 'rolling up their sleeves' to cooperate"", 'After delving into ICER’s methodology, Yang said she came away with one bone to pick with the agency. “Right now, their judgments are based on clinical valuation, but there should be some sort of consideration for the value of innovation,” she said. “We learn something along the way, and there has to be long-lasting value in that. I don’t think that’s being captured.”', 'Pearson’s response? “We are sensitive to the idea that there’s value in having treatments that take different approaches, but we don’t consider innovation as something that’s separate from the benefits to patients and families,” he said. “Innovation matters to patients to the degree it helps them live better lives. If it’s not better for patients, I’m not sure we should be paying more for it.”', 'ICER has recently boosted its efforts to maintain an ongoing dialogue with biopharma developers and insurance companies. The agency adopted a “formal 12-month checkup” policy for each of its published reports, Pearson said. If any new data have been released during that time, reviewers may revisit their original verdict.', 'It also introduced ICER Analytics, a cloud-based portal that houses all of its economic models. Life sciences companies and insurers can subscribe to ICER Analytics. “If [a drugmaker] has new evidence, or if they disagreed with our assumptions the first time around, they can put in their own information and create a different result on fair price,” Pearson said. “We’ll put that side by side with our original results so payers can see it.” More than 50 companies have signed up for trial subscriptions since ICER Analytics launched in November, he said.']","Jun 17, 2021 03:25pm"

Then the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) released a report saying Zolgensma would not be cost-effective at any price higher than $1.5 million.', 'But after Zolgensma was approved and priced, Novartis won over the cost watchdogs by saying it would work with payers to develop outcomes-based installment payments spread over five years. That would bring the per-year cost to $425,000, half what it would cost to treat a patient with the leading chronic drug therapy, Biogen’s Spinraza, for 10 years, Novartis said at the time.

For example, Horizon Blue Cross of New Jersey is not covering the gene therapy for patients previously treated with Spinraza, Bernstein found, and nine of the companies won't allow concurrent treatment with Spinraza.

Bernstein now projects Spinraza sales of nearly $1.4 billion by 2024, not $1 billion as it previously estimated.', 'Other Wall Street firms are even more optimistic about Spinraza’s ability to compete with Novartis’ pricey Zolgensma. The consensus estimate places sales of Spinraza at $2.2 billion this year, with receipts growing slightly each year until 2023, when it peaks at $2.3 billion in sales.', 'So can Novartis overcome early resistance from payers? Absolutely, Bernstein said. The company is running additional trials, which could deliver data to persuade insurance companies to ease up on their coverage restrictions.

The trial therefore wasn’t powered for an overall survival analysis. In addition, 67% patients in the control arm actually went on to receive Breyanzi after disease progression.', 'While clinical data suggest Breyanzi could put up a fight against Yescarta, several factors are currently holding the BMS drug back from reaching its full commercial potential despite it boasting a broader label than Yescarta.', 'In a recent interview with Mizuho, Ran Reshef, M.D., leader of Columbia University Medical Center’s cell therapy program, said he likes both Breyanzi and Yescarta based on their efficacy. But he views Yescarta as having an edge because of better manufacturing success and consistent turnaround time, according to a Mizuho note published Monday.', 'By comparison, BMS reported issues with its Breyanzi manufacturing success rate in the third quarter.

Southern Illinois University also trumpeted the research and the study’s lead researcher, even though he did not rely on traditional U.S. safety oversight in the first trial, held on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts.', 'Neither the Food and Drug Administration nor a safety panel known as an institutional review board (IRB) monitored the testing of a vaccine its creators say prevents herpes outbreaks. Most of the 20 participants were Americans with herpes who were flown to the island several times to be vaccinated, according to Rational Vaccines, the company that oversaw the trial.', '“What they’re doing is patently unethical,” said Jonathan Zenilman, chief of Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center’s Infectious Diseases Division. “There’s a reason why researchers rely on these protections. People can die.”', 'The risks are real. Experimental trials with live viruses could lead to infection if not handled properly or produce side effects in those already infected. Genital herpes is caused by two viruses that can trigger outbreaks of painful sores. Many patients have no symptoms, though a small number suffer greatly. The virus is primarily spread through sexual contact, but also can be released through skin.', 'The push behind the vaccine is as much political as medical. President Trump has vowed to speed up the FDA’s approval of some medicines. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who had deep financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry, slammed the FDA before his confirmation for overprioritizing consumer protection to the detriment of medical innovations.', '“This is a test case,” said Bartley Madden, a retired Credit Suisse banker and policy adviser to the conservative Heartland Institute, who is another investor in the vaccine. “The FDA is standing in the way, and Americans are going to hear about this and demand action.”', 'American researchers are increasingly going offshore to developing countries to conduct clinical trials, citing rising domestic costs. But in order to approve the drug for the U.S. market, the FDA requires that clinical trials involving human participants be reviewed and approved by an IRB or an international equivalent. The IRB can reject research based on safety concerns.', 'Robert Califf, who served as FDA commissioner in the Obama administration until January, said he couldn’t think of a prior instance in which American researchers did not set up an IRB abroad.', 'FEATURED EVENT', '14-16 November 2023', 'London, UK', '“There’s a tradition of having oversight of human experimentation, and it exists for good reasons,” he said. “It may be legal to be doing it without oversight, but it’s wrong.”', 'However, Rational Vaccines downplayed safety concerns, asserting there was little risk the participants would be harmed because they had herpes already. Agustín Fernández III co-founded\xad Rational Vaccines with tenured SIU professor William Halford. He said Halford, the lead investigator, took the necessary precautions during the trial conducted from April to August 2016. Halford died of cancer in June.', 'The university backed its professor’s work by posting a glowing article on its website about the vaccine. SIU is one of the patent holders of the vaccine and set up a business account to collect donations for the work.', 'Nonetheless, Southern Illinois University officials said they had no legal responsibility to ensure safety measures were in place because the university has an arms-length relationship with Rational Vaccines. Fernández said the company licensed two patents related to the vaccine from the university.', '“SIU School of Medicine did not have any involvement in Rational Vaccines’ clinical trial,” said Karen Carlson, the university’s spokeswoman. “But we are confident that as the chief scientific officer of Rational Vaccines, Dr. Halford followed safety protocols appropriate to the clinical trial.”', 'But other researchers said they were appalled by what they described as the university’s complicity in ignoring more than 70 years of safety protocols. Scientists called for more rigorous clinical trial oversight in the wake of Nazi atrocities involving human experiments in the 1940s.', '“You can’t just ignore human-subject protections that have evolved since the end of the Second World War,” said Zenilman, who served as a technical consultant to the presidential commission on bioethical issues during the Obama administration.', 'Zenilman, an expert on sexually transmitted diseases, cited U.S. government research in the late 1940s that deliberately infected study participants in Guatemala (PDF) with sexually transmitted diseases without their consent.', 'In 1974, Congress passed sweeping regulations aimed at protecting human subjects, requiring IRBs in government-funded research. Later, an advisory committee to the U.S. government wrote of the need for safety review committees to ensure that “basic ethical principles” were in place to protect human subjects from harm. The 1979 Belmont Report also urged researchers to balance the risk to the human subject against the benefit of any breakthrough in medicine.', 'While the FDA declined to comment on the herpes vaccine trial, spokeswoman Lauren Smith Dyer said “the FDA believes that the oversight of clinical investigations, including review by an IRB, is critically important and is a regulatory requirement for clinical investigations subject to FDA regulations.”', 'Despite Gottlieb’s stance on the need for FDA streamlining, many researchers are skeptical that he would approve a vaccine based on trials that did not follow American regulations or traditional safety rules for its experiments.', 'Even so, Fernández, a former Hollywood filmmaker, said he and his investors plan to submit the trial data to the FDA in hopes of getting the vaccine approved for treatment. If the FDA does not respond favorably, he said, the company will continue its trials in Mexico and Australia. Fernández said he hopes to set up an IRB for these next trials. No matter what, he plans to manufacture the vaccine offshore. However, without U.S. approval, the challenges to market such a vaccine in the United States remain significant.', 'A Thiel representative said the billionaire was not available to answer questions by email or in an interview. Thiel, who rose to prominence as co-founder of PayPal, reportedly advised Trump on possible FDA nominees after donating $1.25 million to his presidential campaign. Thiel has been a vocal critic of the FDA, claiming in an interview that its approval process was so unwieldy “you would not be able to invent the polio vaccine today.”', 'Fernández said he hoped the trials would put political pressure on the FDA to give the vaccine a closer look. He said his vaccine would be initially aimed at helping patients who experience the “worst of the worst” symptoms. He believed the vaccine eventually would be shown to be effective in preventing the spread of the disease. According to the CDC, more than 1 in 6 people ages 14 to 49 have genital herpes.', '“I will not stop,” said Fernández, who described the trials as his personal mission. “Too many people are suffering.” Before the trial, Halford tested the vaccine on himself and Fernández. After he failed to secure federal funding and an IRB, Halford moved ahead with the trial offshore.', 'Other researchers said they feared that desperate herpes patients would seek to be test participants or get the vaccine without being informed properly of the risk.', 'Researchers at several universities and private clinical research centers are working on two different herpes vaccines under FDA and IRB oversight. One is expected to undergo final trials by 2018 before being submitted to the FDA for final approval. In addition, the National Institutes of Health has conducted a first trial of a third potential vaccine.', 'Califf said drugs and vaccines are often costly to bring to market simply because they initially don’t work or are shown to be unsafe.', '“The FDA is not the problem,” Califf said. “The issue is that there are so many failures.”', 'The vaccine’s researchers told KHN the St. Kitts trial showed the vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing outbreaks in herpes patients.', 'The results (PDF) have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal and Halford’s previous attempt to publish was rejected. Reviewers (PDF) of the paper said they were concerned by the lack of safety and said they were skeptical about his scientific approach.', 'Yet some herpes patients, who are part of a tight-knit online community, have followed the project with hope and enthusiasm.', 'One American participant said he decided to go public with his experience despite the condition’s stigma. Richard Mancuso said he was recruited for the trial on Facebook and grew to be friends with Halford, whom he described as a “hero.”', 'Mancuso said the vaccine has stopped his severe outbreaks. “This has saved my life,” he said.', 'Fernández of Rational Vaccines said another SIU professor, Edward Gershburg, an associate professor in the university’s Department of Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, has agreed to become the company’s chief technical officer.', 'But Kayte Spector-Bagdady, who leads the University of Michigan Medical School’s Research Ethics Service, said the St. Kitts trial could be seen as a violation of SIU’s commitment to the Department of Health and Human Services.', 'SIU voluntarily agreed to follow U.S. safety requirements and set up an IRB for all research involving human subjects, according to records. Many universities make such a commitment to HHS, even if the experiments are abroad and don’t rely on federal grants.', 'Rational Vaccines was established in February 2015 and the company entered into its patent agreement with the university later that year, Fernández said.', 'But when asked about its commitment to HHS, Carlson, the university spokeswoman, said the university first learned about the trial in October 2016—after it had ended. Carlson said Halford didn’t need to bring the trial to SIU’s IRB because the trial wasn’t overseen by the university.', 'However, after a reporter raised questions about the lack of an IRB, Carlson added that the university would “take this opportunity to review our internal processes to assure we are following best practices.”', 'KHN’s coverage of prescription drug development, costs and pricing is supported in part by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.', 'Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.']","Aug 29, 2017 10:00am"

These patients’ cancers were resistant to at least one each of an immunomodulatory agent such as BMS’ Revlimid, a proteasome inhibitor such as Takeda’s Velcade, and an anti-CD38 antibody such as J&J’s Darzalex.', 'But it’s worth noting that the Carvykti data came from 63 patients who got either the BCMA-targeted CAR-T or standard treatment in the CARTITUDE-4 study, whereas the Abecma number was derived from 253 patients in KarMMa-3.', 'In the entire KarMMA-3 trial, which enrolled patients who had tried two to four prior lines of therapy, Abecma mounted a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit of 51% against standard of care. The CARTITUDE-4 trial recruited patients after one to three prior lines of treatment and showed that Carvykti reduced the risk of progression or death by 74%. ', 'One might think that Carvykti’s data looked better because it represents one line earlier than Abecma’s. But just as how Carvykti performed better in the triple-refractory subgroup than in the overall trial population, Carvykti takers who tried two or three prior lines of therapy actually saw a bigger, 76% risk reduction. Among those who just underwent one prior line, Carvykti cut the progression risk by 65%.', '“That means [Carvykti] is very consistent in [its] efficacy; however, standard of care tends to be less efficacious in the heavily pretreated patients—that’s our interpretation,” Ying said.', 'The CARTITUDE-4 win paves the way for Carvykti to move from fifth-line treatment of multiple myeloma to the second line. But to achieve J&J and Legend’s aggressive $5 billion peak sales estimate, Carvykti still needs to make a mark in newly diagnosed patients.', ""After reviewing a leaked abstract of the CARTITUDE-4 data, analysts at SVB Securities wondered whether Carvykti has already reached an efficacy ceiling in the second line. Ying said that isn't the case."", 'In CARTITUDE-4, Carvykti registered a tumor response rate of 85%, including 73% complete responses. That was lower than the 98% overall response rate and 83% complete response rate seen in the CARTITUDE-1 trial in a late-line setting.', 'Carvykti takers went a median 34.9 months without progression in CARTITUDE-1, according to data shared at ASCO 2023. The median PFS in CARTITUDE-4 wasn’t reached at this point. But accounting for a statistical margin of error, the drug’s PFS performance at the lower boundary was slightly worse in the new trial than in the late-line study, which makes one speculate that CARTITUDE-4’s median PFS eventually might not be too different from CARTITUDE-1’s.', 'Reaching an efficacy ceiling would be a problem for Carvykti’s prospect because the PFS bar in front-line myeloma is much higher, the SVB team pointed out in an April note. In the phase 3 MAIA trial, J&J’s Darzalex, used in tandem with Revlimid and dexamethasone, posted a median PFS of 61.9 months in newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible myeloma patients.', 'Those two data points formed the basis of SVB’s concern. But both SVB and Ying noted that the CARTITUDE-4 analysis included some patients who were assigned to received Carvykti but eventually didn’t receive the drug because of rapid progression of disease. In contrast, all patients in CARTITUDE-1 got Carvykti per trial protocol.', 'Excluding 32 patients (15%) in the Carvykti arm that didn’t receive the CAR-T as required, Carvykti’s response rate reached 99.4%, including 86.4% of patients who achieved a complete response. Counting only the as-treated patients, Carvykti’s 12-month PFS rate was also higher in CARTITUDE-4 than in CARTITUDE-1, Ying noted.', 'J&J and Legend have already launched their front-line bid. The phase 3 CARTITUDE-5 trial is testing Carvykti’s use following a combination of Velcade, Revlimid and dexamethasone (VRd) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma not intended for transplant. The comparator is continuous VRd treatment.', 'Ying declined to comment on whether he thinks Carvykti could eventually come above Darzalex’s 61.9-month median PFS, saying he would rather wait for the CARTITUDE-5 readout.', 'For now, J&J and Legend expect to file Carvykti as a second-line treatment with the FDA soon, Ying said. Besides the treatment line, the pair also plans to ask the FDA to expand Carvykti’s manufacturing specification, he said. Doing so would help increase Carvykti’s production success rate.', 'While whether Carvykti has reached an efficacy ceiling remains an open question, a manufacturing bottleneck is very much real for the personalized cell therapy as J&J and Legend struggle to meet demand. After a stagnation at the end of 2022, Carvykti’s sales reached $72 million in the first quarter, up from $55 million in the last three months of 2022.', 'Ying said people should expect a steady increase in Carvykti’s sales as a reflection of improved manufacturing capacity moving forward. The goal is to have 10,000 doses of annual capacity by the end of 2025. J&J and Legend have recently tapped Novartis to help make Carvykti for clinical trials, but it will take some time before Novartis could contribute because of a complex tech transfer process.']","Jun 5, 2023 08:00am"

That was a step up from the mid-single-digit percentage annual growth target that GSK laid out for ViiV back in 2021.', 'Last year, GSK recorded 5.7 billion pounds in HIV drug sales, a 12% increase from 2021 at constant currencies.', 'While the 7 billion pound forecast is new from GSK itself, the number was already raised by ODDO BHF analysts last year.', 'Strong performance of long-acting HIV regimen Cabenuva fueled the new guidance, Waterhouse told reporters during a press call. Approved by the FDA in January 2021, Cabenuva can be given every one or two months. In the first half of 2023, the drug brought in 303 million pounds.', 'Cabenuva is doing well because long-acting drugs—compared with traditional daily orals—give patients a level of freedom so they don’t fear missing daily doses, Waterhouse said.', 'The long-acting regimens will make up about a third of GSK’s HIV revenue by 2026, Waterhouse said. They will help GSK when its older-generation dolutegravir (Tivicay) loses patent protection toward the end of the decade.', 'Dolutegravir’s core composition patent expires in April 2028 in the U.S., while its formulation patents related to the combination therapies Dovato and Juluca expire in 2029 and 2030, respectively, according to Waterhouse.', 'Still, daily pills such as Gilead Sciences’ megablockbuster Biktarvy remain the mainstay of HIV treatment. Waterhouse has previously acknowledged that for some patients, having to go to a clinic every two months to receive Cabenuva can be too cumbersome.', 'That’s why GSK has been working to develop ultra-long-acting drugs and self-administered options. The company on Thursday provided new estimates as to when it expects to bring such products to the market.', 'GSK aims to select a lead self-administered long-acting HIV candidate next year and hopes to win an approval by 2030.', 'In addition, the company plans to incorporate cabotegravir—a component in Cabenuva—into a once-every-four-month treatment by 2027, with a goal to further extend the dosing interval to twice yearly by 2030.', 'The new timeline for the self-administered product marks a delay from GSK’s original plan, shared in 2021.', 'The self-administered version takes longer to develop because GSK needs to find a proper device to deliver the drug, ViiV’s R&D chief Kimberly Smith, M.D., told Fierce Pharma during an interview. For this therapy, GSK is initially targeting a dosing interval of around two to three months, she said.', 'Three factors will determine which regimen GSK will advance, Smith said. Besides sufficient dosing interval and tolerability, the drug must come in the right volume to fit into an autoinjector.', 'GSK has several options to choose from. Besides reformulating cabotegravir, the company has a Shionogi-partnered third-generation integrase inhibitor coded VH184, which also has long-acting potential and the ability to tackle multiple HIV mutations, plus a newer integrase inhibitor called VH310.', '“We do believe that the regimen should be built on a foundation of integrase inhibitors,” Smith said during the press call.', 'GSK’s approach to long-acting regimens is different from rival Gilead’s. Gilead has Sunlenca, a capsid inhibitor that can be given every six months. The drug is approved to be used in combination with other therapies to treat patients whose HIV isn’t controlled by existing treatments.', 'GSK is stressing the importance of integrase inhibitors not because it happens to have several options in the class, but also because they have shown a high barrier to resistance compared with available capsid inhibitors, Smith explained to Fierce Pharma.', 'As for the ultra-long-acting treatments, GSK has set cabotegravir as one of the components but has yet to determine the final regimen. Smith mentioned N6LS, a broadly neutralizing antibody that GSK licensed from the NIH, as a potential combination partner. The drug entered phase 2b testing in August, and GSK is exploring using its partner Halozyme’s drug delivery technology to make it a subcutaneous formulation.', 'Smith suggested that the self-administered and ultra-long-acting therapies might target different patient populations. The dosing interval for ultra-long-acting matches the frequency a patient typically visits the clinic to monitor the disease. Combining the two together allows the doctor to directly observe treatment.', 'By comparison, the self-administered version could appeal to people who are comfortable having their drugs in their house.', 'Eventually, the longer the interval of the clinic-administered drug, the higher the bar for the self-administered version, Smith argued.', '“If you’ve only got to come into the clinic three times a year, do you want the hassle of having it at home?” Smith said. “It’s got to be a really well-tolerated, easy-to-deliver regimen.”']","Sep 28, 2023 09:00am"
