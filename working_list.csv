The agency previously reviewed and accepted the trial design.', 'The trial was designed to “account for the complex global nature of dengue,” Dubin said in a statement.', '“The study was designed per World Health Organization (WHO) guidance for a second-generation dengue vaccine, and it considered the need to achieve high levels of subject retention and protocol compliance in endemic regions,” Takeda pointed out.', 'In a long-term exploratory analysis of the TIDES trial, Qdenga prevented 84% of hospitalizations and 61% of symptomatic dengue illness after four and a half years.

13,"['GSK experienced an eventful 2022. The British drugmaker officially spun out its consumer health joint venture with Pfizer. And the company’s flagship vaccines business appears to be on the mend. But its burgeoning oncology portfolio suffered multiple setbacks.  ', 'On the sidelines of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Fierce Pharma sat down with GSK’s chief commercial officer Luke Miels, who recently took on additional responsibilities in vaccine strategies.  ', ""A wide range of topics were discussed, including GSK’s preparation for upcoming FDA decisions for its RSV vaccine, potential first-in-class chronic kidney disease (CKD) anemia drug daprodustat and newly acquired JAK inhibitor momelotinib, as well as the company’s decisions to either withdraw or limit the use of cancer drugs Blenrep and Zejula. And an upcoming phase 3 readout for a combination of Zejula and GSK's PD-1 inhibitor Jemperli has, as Miels put it, a low chance of success. GSK’s mRNA vaccine collaboration with CureVac and the company’s appetite for additional M&A deals were also included."", ' ', 'Background: After an initial setback with their mRNA COVID vaccine, GSK and partner CureVac came back a few days ago with positive preliminary data for their modified COVID and flu shots. But the question is, with entrenched mRNA players Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, is there any room left for another COVID shot?', ""Miels: “For COVID? Limited. But I think the real interest is in the COVID-flu combination, where I think there is a sizable market opportunity.” Under the deal structure, GSK would capture 90% of the asset’s value. If the mRNA COVID-flu vaccines are successful, the whole COVID market and “a large part” of the flu shot market will covert to the combo because “people prefer one shot instead of two.” To convince people to convert, the COVID component of the combo needs to be “as good as or better than current options.” As for the flu element, the mRNA technology allows for longer time to study the flu season to better choose the dominant strain for the vaccine construct. It also allows for more strains to be included than the current quadrivalent options. MRNA vaccines' tolerability profile could be a challenge in the flu setting, but there's “heavy overlap” between COVID and flu shots takers."", ' ', ""Background: GSK's application for an RSV vaccine for adults 60 years and older is under FDA priority review, with a decision expected by May 3. Pfizer has a candidate targeting the same population also under priority review for a verdict in May. Furthermore, Pfizer touted positive data for its maternal vaccine to protect newborns, but GSK's maternal effort hit a safety hiccup."", ""Miels: GSK will initially focus on high-risk individuals for the RSV launch. There are “a lot of parallels” between RSV and shingles in that vaccine makers need to create an “explained demand” because no RSV preventive solutions were available. But awareness is increasing, and COVID taught people with underlying diseases that they are also at a higher risk of developing serious complications from respiratory diseases, and they could therefore be motivated to get an RSV shot. GSK hopes RSV vaccines could match the penetration levels seen with flu shots. Between the two populations, older adults currently represent a bigger market than newborns. (During the Q&A session after GSK's presentation at JPM, Miels said doctors see “distinct difference” between Pfizer's and GSK's candidates in high-risk patients. The “biggest variable” in its competition with Pfizer right now, Miels said, is whether a vaccine could offer protection longer than one year, and GSK expects to have data on that before its final payer discussions in June.)"", ' ', ""Background: GSK's oncology ambition took a serious hit late 2022 when Blenrep failed as a monotherapy in a confirmatory phase 3 trial. GSK immediately pulled the BCMA-targeted agent's accelerated approval at FDA’s request but put up a bold front for its two phase 3 trials testing a lower Blenrep dose in combinations. Readouts are expected in the first half. Also in blood cancer, GSK’s application for JAK inhibitor momelotinib in myelofibrosis is awaiting an FDA decision by June 16. GSK got momelotinib from its $1.9 billion acquisition of Sierra Oncology last year and, at the time, touted the med's fit with Blenrep in hematology."", 'Miels: GSK has kept the commercial team behind Blenrep in place for a potential momelotinib approval. About 75% of multiple myeloma doctors also treat myelofibrosis. With Blenrep, the problem is about finding the right dose. The FDA has told GSK the original monotherapy dosage is too high. The soon-to-report DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 combo trials could find the optimal dose for Blenrep, and GSK looks to reintroduce the drug if trials are positive.', ' ', ""Background: The FDA recently took issue with concerning patient survival data coming from PARP inhibitors in some ovarian cancer settings. As part of the classwide scrutiny, GSK pulled a Zejula late-line indication and narrowed its second-line maintenance use to just ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations. Despite a broad label in all ovarian cancer patients who've responded to initial chemotherapy treatment, Zejula has mostly only been able to reach patients without homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), while AstraZeneca and Merck's Lynparza continues to hold the lion's share of the HRD-positive market—more specifically, the BRCA-mutant subgroup—in the first-line maintenance setting."", ""Miels: The label reduction affects 20% of Zejula's sales. But it also allows GSK to have another discussion with physicians to try to convince them to use Zejula early in the first-line setting to reap the maximum benefit for patients. The “bulk of physicians” don't extrapolate results in the later-line trials to newly diagnosed patients, and they recognize patient crossovers are a big problem that could muddy the results to the Zejula arm's detriment. Zejula currently captures 50% of new patient starts in first-line maintenance treatment. In doctors' minds, the GSK drug is perceived more as a therapy for nonmutant cases. Lynparza's overall survival data, longer time on the market and broader indications in multiple tumor types make doctors' positive opinions toward Lynparza “difficult to dislodge,” and the current market dynamics will likely stay “static.” GSK also expects a 2023 readout from an adaptive phase 3 trial called FIRST that tests Zejula in combination with GSK's PD-1 inhibitor Jemperli. The study has a very low chance of being successful because ovarian cancer isn't immunogenic. But if that study turns out positive, “that could change people's mind” of Zejula."", ' ', ""Background: GSK recently showed that Jemperli could match up to Keytruda in their respective combinations with chemo in newly diagnosed nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in the phase 2 PERLA trial. Data on tumor shrinkage and delaying tumor progression actually favored Jemperli, though the trial wasn't powered to show statistically significant superiority. Separately, in a small academic-sponsored trial readout that somehow captured the attention of the likes of The New York Times, Jemperli eradicated tumors in all 14 patients with mismatch repair-deficient locally advanced rectal cancer. The results, while not actionable from a regulatory standpoint, could potentially boost Jemperli's competitive edge as a latecomer in the crowded PD-1/L1 space."", ""Miels: “We're not expecting to replace [Keytruda] in the first line. But we did [the PERLA trial], because we wanted to validate in physicians' minds and the FDA's mind that these are comparable.” Those data could help change Jemperli's prescriber base, and PERLA offers GSK a clinical and regulatory pathway to get further approvals for Jemperli in combinations with TIGIT and CD96 inhibitors. Currently, most Jemperli use is in second-line endometrial cancer, but GSK expects a phase 3 readout in first-line endometrial cancer in the first quarter."", ' ', 'Background: The novel HIF-PHI class of oral drugs for anemia in CKD once bore high hopes to displace erythropoietin stimulating agents. But safety signals have derailed two agents, and now it’s up to GSK’s daprodustat. The FDA once again raised cardiovascular safety concerns around daprodustat. During an advisory committee meeting, FDA’s external experts voted in favor of the GSK drug in dialysis-dependent anemic CKD patients but recommended against it in nondialysis population.', 'Miels: If dapro is approved only in dialysis patients, GSK doesn’t plan to run any additional trials to try to resurrect the nondialysis indication. In that scenario, GSK’s commercialization strategy will focus on contracting with dialysis providers. If, in the low chance that dapro also receives an approval in the nondialysis population, it will be a “classical cardiometabolic product launch,” including field force detailing.', ' ', 'Background: GSK narrowed its focus on innovative medicines and vaccines with the spinoff of consumer health venture Haleon. The new GSK’s M&A moves have therefore become a focus among investors. Apart from striking licensing deals like that with CureVac, GSK bought Sierra Oncology for $1.9 billion and took in pneumococcal vaccine developer Affinivax in a deal worth up to $3.3 billion.', 'Miels: GSK will continue to look for acquisitions in that ballpark. Sierra is a great “template deal” for GSK; i.e., in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. “My preference is to do a whole series of deals in that range.” The size may be bigger, “but you’re not going to see us going out and doing Horizon-type transactions.” (In the largest biopharma deal of 2022, Amgen will purchase Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion.) GSK is agnostic about therapeutic areas, but the company intends to focus more on late-stage assets.']","Jan 11, 2023 05:45pm"

The lack of human data added another wrinkle to the increasingly stubborn COVID-19 vaccine market.', 'Now, Moderna is rounding out its case with results from testing its updated vaccine in people—and the data also vouches for the shot against an emerging coronavirus mutation, too. In a phase 2/3 trial of more than 500 adults, Moderna’s bivalent booster mRNA 1273.222 triggered a “significantly higher” immune response against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants compared to an auxiliary dose of the company’s standard vaccine, mRNA-1273, which bears the commercial moniker Spikevax.', 'While the data “appear encouraging on first look,” there are several caveats surrounding the effectiveness of both Pfizer and Moderna’s re-tooled shots, according to a note from Bloomberg Intelligence, posted on Twitter.', 'Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sam Fazeli flagged the fact that Moderna’s study “lack[s] disclosure of antibody titers for the control.” Fazeli also highlighted the fact that those given the bivalent booster had had their previous shot 9.5 months before versus 4.5 months for Spikevax. This gave the bivalent patients more time to “naturally develop more effective antibodies against BA.4/5.”', 'The results come shortly after Moderna published data in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a separate, BA.1-targeting bivalent vaccine—mRNA 1273.214—elicited a superior immune response against BA.1, BA.4 and BA.5 versus Spikevax classic, with that greater protection lasting at least three months.', 'Uncertainties aside, Moderna could certainly use the booster win. After a turbulent third quarter of production and safety “pain points,” the company in early November trimmed its annual sales forecast for Spikevax from $21 billion to a range of $18 billion to $19 billion.

After setting a highly ambitious goal of producing 300 million doses in 2020, the effort produced barely 100 million.', 'In his upcoming book, Warp Speed: Inside the Operation that Beat COVID, the Critics, and the Odds, Paul Mango discusses—with some interesting revelations—the manufacturing constraints that the operation faced and why the pledge proved unrealistic. Mango, the former deputy chief of staff at HHS, followed the agency’s chief Alex Azar when he took a major role with Warp Speed.', 'In the summer of 2020, when Warp Speed identified six vaccine candidates to pursue, the team kicked off a massive manufacturing scale-up from 27 facilities that either were starting from scratch or had to be expanded for vaccine production.', 'No expense was spared. For example, when 2,000-liter vats—used in the manufacture of bulk substance for vaccines—were needed in the U.S., a producer in Switzerland said it had extras on hand and could deliver them by ship in six weeks. But General Gus Perna of Warp Speed—by way of the Army Materiel Command—had an alternate solution.', '“I’ll have military aircraft there tomorrow, so get ready to load,” Perna said, as Mango recalled in a recent interview with Fierce Pharma.', 'The immediate lack of equipment and raw materials needed to produce the vaccines early in the pandemic has been well documented. But according to Mango, the biggest impediment to a quick scale-up was the lack of trained labor.', 'Warp Speed’s manufacturing guru Carlo de Notaristefani, formerly the CEO at Teva, was fully aware of the potential problems posed by the human element in a quick scale up and warned of it.', '“In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the typical approach is to perfect each step in the process and then pull it all together and when you do that, it never works like it’s designed to,” Mango said. “Carlo said, ‘99% of the time, it’s some worker, some trained technician who doesn’t follow procedure. That’s why we get ourselves in trouble with contamination.’ And by the way, that happened along the way.”', 'Mango’s reference, of course, was to the high-profile errors made at Emergent’s Baltimore plant, where millions of doses Johnson & Johnson vaccines had to be discarded because of cross contamination. Officials warned Emergent—which was producing both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines—of the potential for mistakes, Mango said.', 'For its part, Emergent maintains that Operation Warp Speed, FDA and other government officials were onsite on multiple occasions and were engaged in production decisions.', '""Despite the risks that were discussed and well-known by all parties, including the federal government, OWS officials directed Emergent to move forward with tech-transferring and scaling up commercial production of two novel coronavirus vaccine candidates in the facility, due to the pressing needs of the pandemic,"" an Emergent spokesman said.', 'In addition, Warp Speed officials concluded that the concept of holding a facility in reserve—as the United States had done for a decade with Emergent—was flawed, Mango said. Their advice for the future was to have an active vaccine plant with excess capacity up and running with a trained workforce that can be flexed to add capacity. The site could be audited, tested and trained annually to ensure its readiness.', '“It’s too expensive to just have an idle plant,” Mango said. ', 'Emergent agrees that the program was not executed as it was designed. ', '""The initial plan for the [Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing] was for readiness for the production of only 50 million doses of flu vaccine over a four-month period, nowhere near the hundreds of millions of vaccine doses required by the pandemic,"" Emergent\'s spokesman said. ""But even under the original concept, the government never delivered the drug development work necessary to build capacity, develop a skilled workforce, and maintain an adequate state of readiness at any of the CIADM facilities.""', 'Another company that didn’t deliver, Mango said, was Pfizer. The company came up short on its pledge to supply the U.S. with 40 million doses, blaming manufacturing delays which Warp Speed said it wasn’t apprised of.', ""Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment. The company has said, while admitting that it didn't meet the pledge, that the promises were more flexible than portrayed by Mango."", ""Along with its vaccine partner BioNTech, Pfizer quickly overcame its early manufacturing delays to become the world's most prolific supplier of COVID-19 vaccines.

', ""Drugmakers like Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson are homing in on another major hurdle: efficiency. Both companies are testing vaccines that could work after one dose, rather than two, which would stretch supplies to cover more patients. J&J’s adenovirus hopeful, still in phase 3, can also last up to three months refrigerated, or up to two years frozen. J&J in late December said it expects interim data in January and an FDA filing in February. Merck and Themis, meanwhile, are developing a one-dose option using the biotech's virus vector-based platform."", 'Plus, Merck has an oral vaccine in its sights.

AstraZeneca, which is running the global trial of the vaccine it produced with the University of Oxford, said the trial volunteer recovered from a severe inflammation of the spinal cord and is no longer hospitalized.', 'AstraZeneca has not confirmed that the patient was afflicted with transverse myelitis, but Nath and another neurologist said they understood this to be the case. Transverse myelitis produces a set of symptoms involving inflammation along the spinal cord that can cause pain, muscle weakness and paralysis. Britain’s regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, reviewed the case and has allowed the trial to resume in the U.K.', 'AstraZeneca “need[s] to be more forthcoming with a potential complication of a vaccine which will eventually be given to millions of people,” said Nath. “We would like to see how we can help, but the lack of information makes it difficult to do so.”', 'Any decision about whether to continue the trial is complex, because it’s difficult to assess the cause of a rare injury that occurs during a vaccine trial—and because scientists and authorities have to weigh the risk of uncommon side effects against a vaccine that might curb the pandemic.', '“So many factors go into these decisions,” Nath said. “I’m sure everything is on the table. The last thing you want to do is hurt healthy people.”', 'The NIH has yet to get tissue or blood samples from the British patient, and its investigation is “in the planning stages,” Nath said. U.S. scientists could look at samples from other vaccinated patients to see whether any of the antibodies they generated in response to the coronavirus also attack brain or spinal cord tissue.', 'Such studies might take a month or two, he said. The FDA declined to comment on how long it would take before it decides whether to move forward.', 'Jesse Goodman, M.D., a Georgetown University professor and physician who was chief scientist and lead vaccine regulator at the FDA during the Obama administration, said the agency will review the data and possibly consult with British regulators before allowing resumption of the U.S. study, which had just begun when the injury was reported. Two other coronavirus vaccines are also in late-stage trials in the U.S.', 'If it determines the injury in the British trial was caused by the vaccine, the FDA could pause the trial. If it allows it to resume, regulators and scientists surely will be on the watch for similar symptoms in other trial participants.', 'A volunteer in an earlier phase of the AstraZeneca trial experienced a similar side effect, but investigators discovered she had multiple sclerosis that was unrelated to the vaccination, according to Elliot Frohman, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology Center at the University of Texas.', 'Neurologists who study illnesses like transverse myelitis say they are rare—occurring at a rate of perhaps 1 in 250,000 people—and strike most often as a result of the body’s immune response to a virus. Less frequently, such episodes have also been linked to vaccines.', 'The precise cause of the disease is key to the decision by authorities whether to resume the trial. Sometimes an underlying medical condition is “unmasked” by a person’s immune response to the vaccine, leading to illness, as happened with the MS patient. In that case, the trial might be continued without fear, because the illness was not specific to the vaccine.', 'More worrisome is a phenomenon called “molecular mimicry.” In such cases, some small piece of the vaccine may be similar to tissue in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in an immune attack on that tissue in response to a vaccine component. Should that be the case, another occurrence of transverse myelitis would be likely if the trial resumed, said William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A second case would shut down the trial, he said.', 'In 1976, a massive swine flu vaccination program was halted when doctors began diagnosing a similar disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), in people who received the vaccine. At the time no one knew how common GBS was, so it was difficult to tell whether the episodes were related to the vaccine.', 'Eventually, scientists found that the vaccine increased the risk of the disorder by an additional one case among every 100,000 vaccinated patients. Typical seasonal flu vaccination raises the risk of GBS in about one additional case in every 1 million people.', '“It’s very, very hard” to determine if one rare event was caused by a vaccine, Schaffner said. “How do you attribute an increased risk for something that occurs in one in a million people?”', 'Before allowing U.S. trials to restart, the FDA will want to see why the company and an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) in the U.K. felt it was safe to continue, Goodman said. The AstraZeneca trial in the U.S. has a separate safety board.', 'FDA officials will need to review full details of the case and may request more information about the affected study volunteer before deciding whether to allow the U.S. trial to continue, Goodman said. They may also require AstraZeneca to update the safety information it provides to study participants.', 'It’s possible that the volunteer’s health problem was a coincidence unrelated to the vaccine, said Amesh Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Studies aren’t usually stopped over a single health problem, even if it’s serious.', 'Yet many health leaders have expressed frustration that AstraZeneca hasn’t released more information about the health problem that led it to halt its U.K. trial.', '“There is just so little information about this that it’s impossible to understand what the diagnosis was or why the DSMB and sponsor were reassured” that it was safe to continue, Goodman said.', 'AstraZeneca has said it’s unable to provide more information about the health problem, saying this would violate patient privacy, although it didn’t say how.', 'But there’s an exceptional need for transparency in a political climate rife with vaccine hesitancy and mistrust of the Trump administration’s handling of the COVID-19 response, leading scientists say.', '“While I respect the critical need for patient confidentiality, I think it would be really helpful to know what their assessment of these issues was,” Goodman said. “What was the diagnosis? If there wasn’t a clear diagnosis, what is it that led them to feel the trial could be restarted? There is so much interest and potential concern about a COVID-19 vaccine that the more information that can be provided, the more reassuring that would be.”', 'The FDA will need to balance any possible risks from an experimental vaccine with the danger posed by COVID-19, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans.', '“There are also potential consequences if you stop a study,” Goodman said.', 'If the AstraZeneca vaccine fails, the U.S. government is supporting six other COVID-19 vaccines in the hope at least one will succeed. The potential problems with the AstraZeneca vaccine show this to be a wise investment, Adalja said.', '“This is part of the idea of not having just one vaccine candidate going forward,” he said. “It gives you a little more insurance.”', 'Schaffner said researchers need to remember that vaccine research is unpredictable.', '“The investigators have inadvisedly been hyping their own vaccine,” Schaffner said. “The Oxford investigators were out there this summer saying, ‘We’re going to get there first.’ But this is exactly the sort of reason … Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and the rest of us have been saying, ‘You never know what will happen once you get into large-scale human trials.’”', 'This KHN story first published on California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.', 'KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

As for when trial results will be available, “we cannot determine if it will be the middle of October or December.”', 'Safety boards set “stopping rules” at the beginning of a study, making their criteria for ending a trial very clear, said Eric Topol, M.D., executive vice president for research at Scripps Research in San Diego and an expert on the use of data in medical research.', 'Although the safety board can recommend stopping a trial, the ultimate decision to halt a study is made by the scientists running the trial, Topol said.', 'A vaccine manufacturer could then apply to the Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization, which can be granted quickly, or continue through the regular drug approval process, which requires more time and evidence.', 'Safety monitors also can stop a trial because of safety concerns, “if it looks like it’s actually harming people in the vaccine arm, due to a lot of adverse events,” Fauci said.', 'Fauci said people can trust the process, because all the data that outside monitors used to make their decisions would be made public.', '“All of that has to be transparent,” Fauci said. “The only time you get concerned is if there is any pressure to terminate the trial before you have enough data on safety and efficacy.”', 'Topol and other scientists have sharply criticized the FDA in recent weeks, accusing Commissioner Stephen Hahn, M.D., of bowing to political pressure from the Trump administration, which has pushed the agency to approve COVID treatments faster.', 'Stopping trials early poses a number of risks, such as making a vaccine look more effective than it really is, Topol said.', '“If you stop something early, you can get an exaggerated benefit that isn’t real,” because less positive evidence only emerges later, Topol said.', 'Stopping the studies early also could prevent researchers from recruiting more minority volunteers. So far, only about 1 in 5 trial participants are Black or Hispanic. Given that Blacks and Hispanics have been hit harder than other groups by the pandemic, Topol said, it’s important that they make up a larger part of vaccine trials.', 'Ending vaccine trials early also carries safety risks, said Paul Offit, M.D., a vaccine developer who serves on an NIH advisory panel on COVID vaccines and treatments.', 'A smaller, shorter trial could fail to detect important vaccine side effects, which could become apparent only after millions of people have been immunized, said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.', 'Researchers will continue to follow vaccinated volunteers for a full year to look for long-term side effects, Redfield said.', 'And Fauci acknowledged that cutting a trial short could undermine public confidence in COVID vaccines.

Hope and desire for a vaccine to end the global devastation is growing with each passing week.', 'Almost every day, I hear people making plans around the eventual arrival of a coronavirus vaccine—office reopenings, rescheduled weddings, family reunions and international travel. In recent weeks, colleagues and friends have asked me with growing urgency: “When will we have a vaccine? Will it be any good?”', 'At the same time, other friends have been telling me, “When I hear that this is going to be the fastest vaccine developed ever, that doesn’t make me feel good—it makes me feel nervous that they’re going to cut corners.”', 'These questions and concerns resonate with me. I, too, want a vaccine, but I want reassurance that it’s truly safe and effective. So I talked to a dozen people in the vaccine world: scientists, pediatricians, pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as staff at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration.', 'Let me tell you this up front: If you’re imagining there’ll be one golden day when a vaccine is approved and the pandemic will be over—Finally! We can all crowd into one another’s living rooms and resume choir practice again!—I’m afraid it won’t be quite like that. But it will be the beginning of the end.', 'There’s much to be hopeful about, and enormous challenges lie ahead. Let’s dig in.', 'Everyone I spoke to was optimistic that manufacturers would eventually develop a COVID-19 vaccine. This isn’t just because there are so many scientists and pharmaceutical companies working on the endeavor, and so much money being poured into it, though that also raises the chance of success.', 'The goal of vaccine developers is to mimic a natural infection as closely as possible without getting a healthy individual sick. There are many ways to do this. You can give a person a weakened virus or a dead virus. You can also show the immune system just part of the virus. Many manufacturers are creating vaccines involving only the “spike protein,” the part on the surface of the coronavirus that attaches to the human cell it is trying to enter. Once the immune system has learned what the spike protein looks like, when it encounters it again, as part of a real coronavirus, it should know how to defend itself.', 'John Mascola, M.D., director of the Vaccine Research Center at the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he is hopeful because our natural immune system, when healthy, is capable of handling the infection. “Most of the time, people recover from COVID-19, because their immune system eventually clears the virus,” he said. He contrasted the coronavirus to HIV, for which scientists so far have struggled to create an effective vaccine: “In HIV, the natural immune system is not effective and people get AIDS.” In this virus’s case, if we can mimic a natural infection closely enough, it’s likely that a vaccine will work.', 'There are some vaccines that are extremely effective, like the MMR vaccine: One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles; two doses (which is what’s recommended) are about 97% effective.', 'Other vaccines aren’t as perfect. The flu shot’s effectiveness varies year to year. During the 2019-20 flu season, it was about 45% effective at preventing infections, according to the CDC. The year before, it was just 29% effective.', 'The experts I talked to said that the flu shot was an outlier because of the rapidly shifting nature of the influenza virus. Because of its frequent mutations, developers have to make each year’s vaccine based on educated guesses on what strains of the flu virus will be circulating next year. Sometimes, they misjudge, resulting in a vaccine that doesn’t exactly match up with the flu strains that are most prevalent the following season.', '“Influenza changes year in, year out, and the people who get it tend to be extremes in age—elderly and children—so you don’t tend to have as good an immune response,” said Nicholas Kartsonis, M.D., infectious disease and vaccines clinical research lead for Merck, which has two COVID-19 vaccine candidates that it plans to start in human trials this year.', 'One lucky break COVID-19 vaccine developers have had is that this coronavirus hasn’t mutated in any significant way so far, including, crucially, the part that is most visible to the immune system, that spike protein. So long as that remains true, the vaccine they make should match up with the virus that our bodies will encounter in the real world, meaning it’ll likely work as intended. Given the stability seen so far in the coronavirus’s genetic sequence, “I am hopeful that when we do develop a vaccine, it will provide long-term protection,” Kartsonis said.', 'When vaccine manufacturers talk about “effective,” there are two common definitions. One is preventing people from getting sick. The other is preventing people from getting infected at all. In the case of COVID-19, this could be a nontrivial difference.', 'We know now that many people infected with the coronavirus may be asymptomatic carriers, which means that they never feel sick or get symptoms like a cough or fever, even if they are, in fact, infected with the virus. So you can have a vaccine that is effective in that it prevents symptomatic COVID-19, but that doesn’t mean it’ll stop everyone from being infected.', 'Let’s be clear: A vaccine that can significantly reduce sickness would be fantastic. If a vaccine can reduce the severity of COVID-19 so that it’s far less deadly, decrease hospitalizations and minimize symptoms even for those who catch it, that’s a win.', '“In terms of what you’d expect for approval, it should at least be 50% efficacy against symptoms and 70% against moderate to severe disease, to keep you out of the hospital,” said Paul Offit, M.D., director of the vaccine education center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.', 'Even so, it’s important not only to measure what the vaccine does, but also for politicians, health officials and journalists to clearly explain to the public exactly what it is that the vaccine is capable of doing. If it ends up that the first vaccine to go to market is “70% effective,” we should be clear on whether it is 70% effective at reducing sickness or infection, so members of the public have the appropriate context and don’t feel let down if they are vaccinated and still get a mild case of COVID-19.', 'When experimental vaccines are tested, they usually go through three phases of clinical trials. The first phase is the smallest and focuses on safety, making sure that the product doesn’t have any dangerous health effects. The second is a little larger, continuing to gather safety data while testing if the vaccine can induce an immune response, producing antibodies in participants. The third trial is the largest, and it needs to be big enough to confirm that the vaccine is actually effective in the real world.', 'Moderna Therapeutics is currently expected to be the first U.S. manufacturer to start a phase 3 trial. Candidates by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson will follow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Moderna’s trial is planned to begin in July and will enroll about 30,000 participants. Half will get the vaccine and half will get a placebo, according to Moderna’s chief medical officer Tal Zaks, M.D. (I should disclose: Paul Sagan, chairman of ProPublica’s board, is also one of Moderna’s board members. That said, ProPublica’s board members have no say in what reporters write about, nor do they know about articles before they are published.)', 'The participants will be tracked carefully throughout the study. If they have any symptoms related to COVID-19, they’ll get tested to see if they have contracted the virus. The participants will also get blood drawn at regular intervals to get tested for antibodies, which will determine if they got infected but perhaps didn’t know because they didn’t develop symptoms.', '“But wait!” you say. “Doesn’t a vaccine also create antibodies? How can you tell by looking in a participant’s blood whether the antibodies come from the vaccine or from an infection that the vaccine failed to prevent?” Excellent question.', 'At least for Moderna’s vaccine trial, here’s how they’re going to tell the difference: Moderna’s vaccine is what’s known as an mRNA vaccine. Instead of using the actual virus or even a little bit of the virus, it uses a piece of genetic code, kind of like a recipe, that gives instructions for making the spike protein. Once injected into the arm and introduced into human cells, the cell’s protein-making factories read the recipe and manufacture the spike protein, churning out copies for the immune system to check out. The immune system should then create antibodies that correspond to the spike protein, like a matching puzzle piece.', 'When you get infected by an actual coronavirus, however, there are more parts to it than just the spike protein. Your body will produce other antibodies that match up with other parts of the virus, including what’s called the nucleoprotein, found inside the virus. We can also measure for those antibodies in a trial participant’s blood, the NIH’s Mascola explained. So if we find so-called NP antibodies, that means you’ve been infected for real, because there’s no way you could induce NP antibodies from the vaccine alone.', 'The Moderna trial is designed to end when a predetermined number of people have gotten sick, according to Zaks. Then, the study investigators will count up the number of people that have gotten sick in the placebo arm and compare it with the vaccine arm. Hopefully, there will be far fewer in the vaccinated cohort.', 'There’s one more question that a phase 3 trial cannot answer: How long will protection last? Right now, we don’t even know if people who have gotten sick via natural infection have lifelong immunity. The only way to find out how long a vaccine’s protection lasts will be to keep tracking study participants and whether their antibody levels drop over time. We may end up needing periodic booster shots. Truly, only time will tell.', 'To give you a sense of what a blistering pace we are attempting to move at, consider that under normal circumstances, it typically takes 10 to 15 years (PDF) to develop a vaccine. Creating the HPV vaccine was a 15-year journey from key research findings in 1991 until the vaccine was approved, initially for the prevention of cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers, in 2006. Merck’s Ebola vaccine, one of the fastest ever to be approved, still took about four years from start to finish, according to Kartsonis.', 'The speed of the phase 3 trials depends on the rate of infection wherever people are enrolled. If there is a huge outbreak going on, people in the placebo group will get sick at a high rate, and the trial may be over in a matter of a few months. If infection rates are very low, however, the trial could drag on for months on end. Moderna hasn’t announced its trial sites yet, but it will have sites “well dispersed” in the U.S. and is considering international trials as well, according to a spokesman.', '“There have been some European countries that wanted to be part of our trial, and we said: ‘Look at your epidemiology, you’re a victim of your own success—there’s just not enough cases happening. It would take five years!’” Moderna’s Zaks said. “So speed here is going to be enabled by what we anticipate is ongoing attack rates. We expect there will be infections amongst the participants on our trial.”', 'Still, there have been discussions of some potential ways to speed up trials even more. One common proposal is to conduct what are known as challenge trials, in which vaccinated participants are deliberately “challenged” with the coronavirus to see if they get sick.', 'This idea was dismissed as unethical by some experts I interviewed. “We don’t have a treatment—we can’t guarantee to any volunteer that if we gave them a challenge with the actual virus, that it wouldn’t make them very, very sick,” said William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt Medicine. “That would make a lot of people very uneasy.”', 'The other shortcoming of approving a vaccine via a challenge trial is that because of the inherently risky nature of giving participants a live virus, challenge trials are typically very small. “That diminishes the safety database, and you need a large safety database to give us comfort to communicate to the public that we think that this is a safe vaccine,” Schaffner said.', 'Another potential would be to green light use of a vaccine based on expected benefit, if manufacturers can show it reliably generates levels of antibodies in study participants that are similar to those found in people who have been naturally infected. Not everyone is a fan of that idea—some experts I interviewed told me that immune responses aren’t always predictive of a vaccine’s real-world capabilities. (Read more about this discussion.)', 'In the phase 3 trials currently being planned, the vaccines will be tested in adults. People over the age of 55 are being specifically recruited, and it’s important to include them because the need for the vaccine in that demographic is particularly high.', 'One group that won’t be in the initial set of phase 3 trials: children.', 'This is for two reasons. First, as a safety precaution, the NIH’s Mascola explained. Traditionally, when running trials with an experimental vaccine or drug, developers make sure it’s safe in adults before moving on to children. Second, for the COVID-19 vaccine specifically, the most acute need isn’t in children.', 'This means that when the vaccine is first approved, it likely won’t be available for those under 18, because it hasn’t yet been studied in that population. However, Mascola said there are already discussions for how to run future trials for children. Moderna will eventually run trials in children, Zaks confirmed.', 'Another special population is pregnant women. They are also not going to be enrolled in the initial phase 3 trial for the Moderna vaccine, according to Zaks. But Mascola said that it’s essential that that population eventually be studied. “If we’re not able to immunize women of childbearing age, that excludes a large proportion of the population. There’s a strong interest in getting those studies done,” he said. “The FDA is encouraging companies/sponsors to include in their development plans studies that would provide data to support use of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy,” the agency said in a statement.', 'The FDA added that it “strongly encourages the enrollment of populations most affected by COVID-19, specifically racial and ethnic minorities.” African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, contracting the virus and dying at higher rates.', 'One strategy that everyone agreed was a safe way to save a whole lot of time without any risk to human health is what’s known as “manufacturing at risk.” This is one of the key components of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed, which is supporting five candidates with billions of dollars of federal funding.', 'Typically, drugmakers will manufacture only enough doses for clinical trials and make sure the trials are successful before starting mass production. Manufacturing at risk means that developers will instead begin mass production at the same time as clinical trials, which means that if a vaccine fails in human trials, they’ll have to throw away all the product they’ve made, wasting money and materials. But if a product is successful, it means that the minute its trial is completed, there’ll be millions of doses ready to go.', 'Manufacturing at a massive scale is no simple task. “If we’re going to immunize 300 million people in the U.S.—we don’t even do that with the flu vaccine every year—we need a lot of glass vials, we have to make sure we have printing supplies and paper to make the labels and package inserts, we need stoppers for the vials, and they all need to be made to a very high standard. All this in addition to the raw materials to the vaccine itself,” Schaffner said.', 'Pfizer and its partner, German company BioNTech, are planning to have a few million doses ready by the end of the year, and hundreds of millions of doses available in 2021, even though the first of their four vaccine candidates just began its first early-stage human trials in May. The companies are currently preparing manufacturing facilities in St. Louis, Andover, Massachusetts, and Kalamazoo, Michigan, as well as in Europe, according to Philip Dormitzer, M.D., Ph.D., Pfizer’s vice president and chief scientific officer for viral vaccines.', 'On the day that a vaccine is approved, you’ll find me jumping up and down in my apartment, cheering loudly enough to startle my neighbors. And then … I’ll keep on washing my hands, wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing.', 'Why? Because I know that when a vaccine is first approved by the FDA, there won’t be enough available for everyone who wants it. There will need to be a prioritization, with the vaccine given first to those who need it most: essential workers and the elderly. As a healthy adult who is fortunate to be able to work from home, I’ll be nowhere near the front of the inoculation line.', 'Distribution is going to be a massive challenge. “There’s a need to have in place a mechanism to ensure people who should get the vaccine get it,” Walter Orenstein, M.D., associate director of Emory University’s vaccine center, said. “We won’t have 8 billion vaccines. So who should get priority, and how should it get delivered? We will need to remove barriers to access, including cost and distance.”', 'In all likelihood, we’ll have several vaccines that come to market and are in use at the same time, because of the unprecedented need to vaccinate so many people around the globe. No one company has the manufacturing capability to make it all.', 'There may also be differences in what works best for different countries and populations. Some of the vaccines will require cold shipping or storage. Some will require two doses (Moderna’s is a two-dose vaccine, taken a month apart). All these variations will add to the complexity of delivery and distribution.', '“Since I have gray hair, I’m trying to remind my colleagues that in previous distribution and prioritization schemes, flexibility is very important,” Schaffner warned me. He has long worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice, which reviews data on vaccines and gives recommendations on which populations they should be used for. He is now on the COVID-19 vaccine working group. “Adverse events will come up that have to become investigated. There will be bumps in the road. War plans are great, until the war starts. Then you will have to be flexible.”', 'Vaccinating 15,000 to 20,000 people before approval should give regulators a large pool of data to help them understand what side effects are to be expected and help ensure that the vaccines that go to market don’t have any major safety issues.', 'But of course, 20,000 people isn’t 20 million or 200 million or 2 billion people.', '“When we have tens of thousands of people being evaluated, we can at least pick up safety signals for serious adverse events for the more frequent adverse events,” Orenstein said. “Now for very rare events, if it’s 1 per million, you’re not going to catch that in clinical trials.”', 'What everyone wants to avoid is a repeat of the mass immunization program following the swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix in 1976. After 45 million doses were distributed, the vaccine was found to be associated with increased cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause paralysis and sometimes death. Even worse, there wasn’t actually a pandemic—the program had been launched in fears that the swine flu virus circulating among recruits at Fort Dix would cause a catastrophic outbreak. In the end, there was no transmission across the U.S., and the vaccination program was canceled.', 'So there will need to be some sort of mechanism to track and monitor for rare safety events even after the vaccine goes on the market. There is already a program to do so, which is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, run by the CDC.', 'While it may be impossible for a phase 3 trial to catch a very rare potential side effect, Offit, of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, points out that “it’s not a risk-free choice to not get the vaccine, if the virus is still circulating.”', 'He added, “If the data were clear that in 20,000 people it appears to be safe and highly efficacious, then you should get the vaccine, because if you’re choosing not to get a vaccine, you’re choosing to risk getting a natural infection, which could be fatal.”', 'The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed has said it “aims to have substantial quantities of a safe and effective vaccine available for Americans by January 2021.”', 'Experts I’ve spoken to have ranged in their optimism about that timeline. The NIH’s Mascola said, “If a study is started in the summertime, it’s possible that by the end of the year we’ll have an answer.”', 'Luciana Borio, M.D., former FDA acting chief scientist and current vice president at In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit strategic investment firm, concurred. “Depending on the results of the clinical trials, I think we might see some vaccine become available before the end of the year, but most people will have to wait for 2021.”', 'Others were more cautious. Orenstein said he thinks there is a “real possibility” that we will have a vaccine by summer next year, “if everything goes well.”', 'Vanderbilt’s Schaffner said he prefers to avoid timelines altogether. “We’re making the same mistake we made back in 2009 when we developed the H1N1 vaccine. We made the same statements and then it took more time than people anticipated, and when it finally came out, the media all said, ‘It’s a late vaccine!’', '“So we overpromised and underdelivered in 2009, and we haven’t learned that lesson. We are overpromising now, and I wish we wouldn’t do that.
